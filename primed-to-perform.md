# Primed to Perform

## Chapter 1: what is total motivation?

### Motive spectrum: six reasons we work:

**Direct motives => increase performance**

1. Play: curiosity and experimentation
2. Purpose: values and believes aligned with impact of work
3. Potential: work towards personal goals

**Indirect motives => decrease performance**

4. Emotional pressure: disappointment, guilt, or shame
5. Economic pressure: to win a reward or avoid punishment, extrinsic
6. Inertia: because we do it everyday

According to Dan Pink: mastery, autonomy, purpose.
Mastery could be a subset of potential. Purpose is purpose.
So what is missing is autonomy in the above.

They haven't directly address autonomy by definition. But looking at their various examples,
for example, the call centre example, they gave the team a lot more autonomy,
to choose their own path and actions.

> In business, we tend to obsess over the "how"—as in "Here's how to do it."
Yet we rarely discuss the "why"—as in "Here's why we're doing it."
But it's often difficult to do something exceptionally well
if we don't know the reasons we're doing it in the first place.  
> -- Dan Pink

In a way, similar to: "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA

## Chapter 2: the total motivation factor

Can be applied not just to work, but also to learning, children, fitness, health...
As long as you enjoy the activity, you will do actually do it more often.

> First, direct motives typically enhance performance while indirect motives decrease it.
Second, the closer the motive is to the work itself, the better the performance.
Play is the strongest motive. Then purpose. Then potential.
Inertia is the most destructive, then economic pressure, then emotional pressure.

--
> Play is about two times more powerful than purpose,
which is about three times more powerful than potential.
Inertia is about two times more damaging than economic pressure,
which is about three times more damaging than emotional pressure.

--
> Being able to objectively measure the strength of a culture is a true game changer.

--
> Fostering play at work has been an explicit part of Southwest's strategy
to deliver what they call POS—positively outrageous service.

--
> Play and purpose are also assisted by limiting the number of management layers
between the CEO and the front line,
and enabling local employees at each airport to make decisions.
"We've tried to create an environment where people...
don't have to convene a meeting of the sages in order to get something done," [Herb Kelleher]

--
> Your employees come first. And if you treat your employees right, guess what?
Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy.
Start with employees and the rest follows from that.  
> -- Herb Kelleher

"Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think":

Skeptical about a couple of the examples that
are not usually considered as companies that look after their employees: Walmart, and Amazon.

For this to work, you need to provide a level of safety to be autonomous and play.
Interested to see if they cover this in the book.
Also interested in how to deal with personal vs team goals, especially if they are at odds.

Monetary incentives don't increase performance and productivity.

The premise is that performance is predicable, and measurable.
