# Primed to Perform

## Chapter 1: what is total motivation?

### Motive spectrum: six reasons we work:

**Direct motives => increase performance**

1. Play: curiosity and experimentation
2. Purpose: values and believes aligned with impact of work
3. Potential: work towards personal goals

**Indirect motives => decrease performance**

4. Emotional pressure: disappointment, guilt, or shame
5. Economic pressure: to win a reward or avoid punishment, extrinsic
6. Inertia: because we do it everyday

According to Dan Pink: mastery, autonomy, purpose.
Mastery could be a subset of potential. Purpose is purpose.
So what is missing is autonomy in the above.

They haven't directly address autonomy by definition. But looking at their various examples,
for example, the call centre example, they gave the team a lot more autonomy,
to choose their own path and actions.

> In business, we tend to obsess over the "how"—as in "Here's how to do it."
Yet we rarely discuss the "why"—as in "Here's why we're doing it."
But it's often difficult to do something exceptionally well
if we don't know the reasons we're doing it in the first place.
> -- Dan Pink

## Chapter 2: the total motivation factor

Can be applied not just to work, but also to learning, children, fitness, health...
As long as you enjoy the activity, you will do actually do it more often.

> First, direct motives typically enhance performance while indirect motives decrease it.
Second, the closer the motive is to the work itself, the better the performance.
Play is the strongest motive. Then purpose. Then potential.
Inertia is the most destructive, then economic pressure, then emotional pressure.

--
> Play is about two times more powerful than purpose,
which is about three times more powerful than potential.
Inertia is about two times more damaging than economic pressure,
which is about three times more damaging than emotional pressure.

--
> Being able to objectively measure the strength of a culture is a true game changer.

--
> Fostering play at work has been an explicit part of Southwest's strategy
to deliver what they call POS—positively outrageous service.

--
> Play and purpose are also assisted by limiting the number of management layers
between the CEO and the front line,
and enabling local employees at each airport to make decisions.
"We've tried to create an environment where people...
don't have to convene a meeting of the sages in order to get something done," [Herb Kelleher]

--
> Your employees come first. And if you treat your employees right, guess what?
Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy.
Start with employees and the rest follows from that.
> -- Herb Kelleher

"Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think":
https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation/transcript

Skeptical about a couple of the examples that
are not usually considered as companies that look after their employees: Walmart, and Amazon.

For this to work, you need to provide a level of safety to be autonomous and play.
Interested to see if they cover this in the book.
Also interested in how to deal with personal vs team goals, especially if they are at odds.

Monetary incentives don't increase performance and productivity.

The premise is that performance is predicable, and measurable.

## Chapter 3: rethinking performance

Total Motivation is the Missing Link between culture and organisation

reads the heading, but we got lost in the detail of this chapter. Although it was filled with interesting things, some felt it didn't successfully argue this point well.

> The correlation to lifetime creative accomplishment was more than three times stronger for childhood creativity than childhood IQ
-- Newsweek

This was demonstrated with several examples, not just in the long term, but also in the immediate short term after being primed to perform creatively or not.

When building high-performing organisations, you need to understand and optimise two different, opposing types of performance:

Tactical performance: how well a person executes a plan (productivity, efficiency, and control)
Adaptive performance: a person's or organisation's ability to diverge from the plan (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity)

> The milirary uses the phrase "VUCA" to describe the limitations of tactical performance and why adaptive performance is so crucial.

VUCA ( Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity )

> Tactical performance is not enough to address VUCA

> Adaptive performance behaviours are very difficult and sometimes impossible to measure. As a result, they are almost always neglected.

Tactical and adaptive performance are the opposites of each other. Companies often sacrifice adaptive performance for tactical performance, at their expense.

Why do indirect motives reduce adaptibility, but direct motives increase it?

* The Distraction Effect
  When a job requires only tactical performance, indirect motivators can increase performance but, when adaptive performance is required, indirect motivators can make performance worse.

The economic pressure distracted them because they focused on the stakes, not just the work.

* The Cancellation effect
  Numerous studies exist showing that performance-based rewards cancel out the natural sense of play, reducing persistence.
* The Cobra effect
    Delhi wanted less cobras, so they provided a bounty for dead cobras. People started cobra farms to profit. The city killed the scheme, all the farmed cobras were released and they ended up with more cobras then when they started. More generally, they measured the wrong thing, dead cobras vs less live cobras, and so the motivation failed.

We decided that these three problems are not nessecarily escalations of each other, but they are closely linked. Whether there is correlation or causation of indirect motivation was debated a little.

Although we can identify these problems in our own workplaces, the book as yet offers no solutions. We shared stories of these effects in our own workpaces:
* In product distribution and sales, staff were incentivised by targets to sell only to the targets, and if there was little chance of meeting a target, deffering a sale to the next month was common. Some buyers learned this and could take advantage.
* Car dealers are incentivised to sell a specific number of cars in their sales period, and will offer discounts to meet those targets.

The usual way companies try to prevent this from happening is by adding more oversight. The book points out this is a bad idea.

## Chapter 4: The Yin and Yang of Performance

Total Motivation (ToMo) is good in individuals, but even better in organisations.

Tactics vs Strategy

> Strategy gives us our destination and the path to get there

Strategy is compared with Culture.

> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. Then, like a rat, they stop in fear and freeze.

Cliched quote from Mike Tyson that has been overused, and is a variant of several quotes over the last few hundred years.

Nevertheless, it demonstrates that adaptability is important, and adaptability has to be built into a companies culture. When VUCA happens, adaptablility will save you.

Most of us were not convinced this chapter was successful in arguing this point clearly.

** emergence **

The biological concept of emergence is explained using termites as a successful example of a species with emergent behaviour. No mention is given of successful but non-adaptive species.

> Emergence occurs when the individual components of a collective are able to organize themselves into a system that is far more complicated than the sum of its parts. These systems are almost always self-organized and have incredible levels of adaptive performance.

The need to adapt to climate variability is given as a reason why humans have such large brains. This doesn't appear to be a widely accepted evolutionary theory, this bit was a bit over-cooked.

** complexity **

Three categories of company are provided, from very rigid to extremely adaptable. The most adaptable is lauded as the best choice, but this seems to contradict what was said earlier about the Ying and Yang balance of Tactics vs Strategy.

** general thoughts from the last two chapters **

We feel that salary and bonuses, considered maladaptive incentives in the book, do make us feel valued by our employers.

Wikipedia was given as a highly successful adaptive organisation with a flat structure of motivated volunteers. We wonder what tactics they use to achieve this. We appreciated that they recognised wikipedia's recent difficulties as well.

Stack overflow is an interesting parallel to wikipedia, it uses gamification to motivate people.

A trucking company uses a flat structure, and autonomous cells to make decisions, there are more examples in [Reinventing Organizations](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/).

## 5: The bias blame

### Our bias to blame causes us to lead through indirect motives

--

> Indirect motivators can lead to narrow, short-term increases in tactical performance that are easy to measure.

--

We look for reasons to explain outcomes that don't fit our intuition.

We find it hard to believe in random acts of kindness.

Adam: we can't be sure why the people did the nice thing and mailed the letter, even though it was presented as a definite thing.

It takes very little to make someone feel like a citizen.

> Our intuition struggles to believe that people’s decisions can be so dramatically affected by small changes to their context.

Monopoly game: did I win because of skills? or privilege?

Same as with web application, we tend to blame ourselves, rather than the system.

> The more removed we are from someone, the more likely we are to blame them.

Fundamental attribution error

> Because the blame bias causes us to blame the player, not the game, we focus on prodding the player, not changing the game. The easiest way to prod is through indirect motivators. We concoct more potent sticks and carrots. We spend weeks on performance evaluations, but very little time on culture building. We invest all sorts of energy in hiring the right people and then underestimate the influence of our culture once they arrive.

Motivators survey: "Surprisingly, pay didn’t even make the top three—they ranked it fourth."

This completely ignores how money actually works. Of course a bunch of MBAs aren't concerned about money. Once you have *enough* money for whatever your needs, *then* you can focus on other priorities/motivators.

> Across each industry, employees believed that their colleagues had less total motivation than they did (see Figure 13). And not just a little bit less. On average people believed that their colleagues were 19 points lower on ToMo than they were!

**Antidote: believe people are motivated and have potential. Like a self fulfilling prophecy. "Pygmalion effect"**

> By tricking the officers into believing that some of their students were naturally high performers, the blame bias was eliminated. With no blame bias standing in the way, these leaders naturally became higher ToMo. For example, if high-CP students had a problem learning a military concept like VUCA, the leader didn’t blame the learners. It couldn’t be their fault because they had such high command potential. Therefore the leader is forced to confront the context rather than the individuals. ToMo increases. If average-CP students struggle with a concept, it is easier to blame them. When the learners are blamed, the leader naturally gravitates toward indirect motivators, and thus ToMo decreases. With it, performance decreases.

--
> The Pygmalion effect is the flip side of the blame bias. Once blame is eliminated, expectations increase. When expectations increase, a leader more naturally uses the principles of total motivation, which inevitably improve performance.

--
> high expectations create high performance, low expectations diminish it.

Treat people according to how we expect them to perform.

REAP model of feedback:

1. Remember: assume positive intent
1. Explain: come up with 5 possible scenarios to explain the behaviour
1. Ask: why?
1. Plan: together identify the root cause of the problem and develop a plan to remedy it

**Toyota Way "Genchi Genbutsu"**

**> Adaptive performance demands objectivity and an open mind.**

## 6: Frozen or fluid

### When we most need fluid organisations, we freeze them instead

> No one person can impose adaptability. That’s what culture is for.

Lemonade stands experiments: one groups was given space to play and experiment

#### Crossroads:

1. Foundation: focus on building a product, or a product and a culture.
1. Scale up: many opt for skills and quantities rather than cultural fit.
1. Institutionalising - around 150 people, organisations become too large for informal processes.
1. Renewal

Are they referencing Dunbar's Number with the 150? It's not clear from the text.

#### Case study: Medallia

Medallia's founders: "culture is not secondary to our mission. It’s the only way to achieve the mission.”

> She’s lived in five different countries, where she realized that many things she took as fact were actually culturally determined.

--
> "...that, our modus operandi had been: ‘hire smart, talented, nonjerk people and they’ll do the right thing.’ But we realized that many smart, decent, good people were not coachable because they were afraid of not being perfect.”

--
> Pressman had struggled to codify the criteria for the culture interview. She and Hald still wanted their “no jerks” culture, but in reality, they were searching for something more nuanced than just decency. They could have crossed their fingers and hoped to hire people who naturally saw the world their way. But they decided to develop a scalable framework for the culture interview by hiring a psychology doctoral student from Stanford.

--
> the difference between average and distinctive performance lay in a person’s whys.

Induction / onboarding: a week long onboarding program:

1. Welcome letter and two gifts: fitbit to grow your health and wellbeing, and a kindle to grow your mind
1. On the first day, new hires are asked to do something to make the company a better place
1. Each person is asked to do something to challenge their self-imposed barriers to personal growth
1. Hiring manager describes the special spark that led to the job offer

> Today, Medallia has one culture leader for every two hundred fifty people, a data scientist who applies rigorous metrics to culture and performance, and over twenty certified cultural interviewers.

--
> Onboarding primes play, but it’s not enough to maintain a high–total motivation culture.

- Leaders are taught to actively combat the blame bias and assume good intent.
- Create space for play
- People meet weekly to share what they've learnt and celebrate victories - to increase play and purpose, of feeling sense of belonging and pride in their work
- Performance reviews are more about self-reflection exercises, and review conversations about what they've learnt. Feedback is designed to help that person grow, not to establish a year-end grade.
- Career ladders to help people understand the skills they need to learn over time. The ladder criteria include tactical skills for each role, as well as cultural and leadership behaviours.

> “If you look at the cost per hire alone, our culture programs more than pay for themselves.”

**“a tree that is unbending is easily broken.”**

#### Summary:

- The objective of a high-performance culture is to maximise adaptability.
- Adaptive organisations require adaptive individuals—people with high levels of creativity, problem solving, persistence, and citizenship.
- ​Individuals adapt when they have high total motivation. The more that people work for the direct motives, and the less that people work for the indirect motives, the more adaptive they will be.
- ​Great organisations build high-ToMo cultures. They resist their bias to blame individuals. They resist the temptation to freeze. They balance the yin and yang of tactical and adaptive performance.
