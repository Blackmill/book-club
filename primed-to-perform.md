# Primed to Perform

## Chapter 1: what is total motivation?

### Motive spectrum: six reasons we work:

**Direct motives => increase performance**

1. Play: curiosity and experimentation
2. Purpose: values and believes aligned with impact of work
3. Potential: work towards personal goals

**Indirect motives => decrease performance**

4. Emotional pressure: disappointment, guilt, or shame
5. Economic pressure: to win a reward or avoid punishment, extrinsic
6. Inertia: because we do it everyday

According to Dan Pink: mastery, autonomy, purpose.
Mastery could be a subset of potential. Purpose is purpose.
So what is missing is autonomy in the above.

They haven't directly address autonomy by definition. But looking at their various examples,
for example, the call centre example, they gave the team a lot more autonomy,
to choose their own path and actions.

> In business, we tend to obsess over the "how"—as in "Here's how to do it."
Yet we rarely discuss the "why"—as in "Here's why we're doing it."
But it's often difficult to do something exceptionally well
if we don't know the reasons we're doing it in the first place.
> -- Dan Pink

In a way, similar to: "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA

## Chapter 2: the total motivation factor

Can be applied not just to work, but also to learning, children, fitness, health...
As long as you enjoy the activity, you will do actually do it more often.

> First, direct motives typically enhance performance while indirect motives decrease it.
Second, the closer the motive is to the work itself, the better the performance.
Play is the strongest motive. Then purpose. Then potential.
Inertia is the most destructive, then economic pressure, then emotional pressure.

--
> Play is about two times more powerful than purpose,
which is about three times more powerful than potential.
Inertia is about two times more damaging than economic pressure,
which is about three times more damaging than emotional pressure.

--
> Being able to objectively measure the strength of a culture is a true game changer.

--
> Fostering play at work has been an explicit part of Southwest's strategy
to deliver what they call POS—positively outrageous service.

--
> Play and purpose are also assisted by limiting the number of management layers
between the CEO and the front line,
and enabling local employees at each airport to make decisions.
"We've tried to create an environment where people...
don't have to convene a meeting of the sages in order to get something done," [Herb Kelleher]

--
> Your employees come first. And if you treat your employees right, guess what?
Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy.
Start with employees and the rest follows from that.
> -- Herb Kelleher

"Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think":
https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation/transcript

Skeptical about a couple of the examples that
are not usually considered as companies that look after their employees: Walmart, and Amazon.

For this to work, you need to provide a level of safety to be autonomous and play.
Interested to see if they cover this in the book.
Also interested in how to deal with personal vs team goals, especially if they are at odds.

Monetary incentives don't increase performance and productivity.

The premise is that performance is predicable, and measurable.

## Chapter 3: rethinking performance

Total Motivation is the Missing Link between culture and organisation

reads the heading, but we got lost in the detail of this chapter. Although it was filled with interesting things, some felt it didn't successfully argue this point well.

> The correlation to lifetime creative accomplishment was more than three times stronger for childhood creativity than childhood IQ
-- Newsweek

This was demonstrated with several examples, not just in the long term, but also in the immediate short term after being primed to perform creatively or not.

When building high-performing organisations, you need to understand and optimise two different, opposing types of performance:

Tactical performance: how well a person executes a plan (productivity, efficiency, and control)
Adaptive performance: a person's or organisation's ability to diverge from the plan (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity)

> The milirary uses the phrase "VUCA" to describe the limitations of tactical performance and why adaptive performance is so crucial.

VUCA ( Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity )

> Tactical performance is not enough to address VUCA

> Adaptive performance behaviours are very difficult and sometimes impossible to measure. As a result, they are almost always neglected.

Tactical and adaptive performance are the opposites of each other. Companies often sacrifice adaptive performance for tactical performance, at their expense.

Why do indirect motives reduce adaptibility, but direct motives increase it?

* The Distraction Effect
  When a job requires only tactical performance, indirect motivators can increase performance but, when adaptive performance is required, indirect motivators can make performance worse.

The economic pressure distracted them because they focused on the stakes, not just the work.

* The Cancellation effect
  Numerous studies exist showing that performance-based rewards cancel out the natural sense of play, reducing persistence.
* The Cobra effect
    Delhi wanted less cobras, so they provided a bounty for dead cobras. People started cobra farms to profit. The city killed the scheme, all the farmed cobras were released and they ended up with more cobras then when they started. More generally, they measured the wrong thing, dead cobras vs less live cobras, and so the motivation failed.

We decided that these three problems are not nessecarily escalations of each other, but they are closely linked. Whether there is correlation or causation of indirect motivation was debated a little.

Although we can identify these problems in our own workplaces, the book as yet offers no solutions. We shared stories of these effects in our own workpaces:
* In product distribution and sales, staff were incentivised by targets to sell only to the targets, and if there was little chance of meeting a target, deffering a sale to the next month was common. Some buyers learned this and could take advantage.
* Car dealers are incentivised to sell a specific number of cars in their sales period, and will offer discounts to meet those targets.

The usual way companies try to prevent this from happening is by adding more oversight. The book points out this is a bad idea.

## Chapter 4: The Yin and Yang of Performance

Total Motivation (ToMo) is good in individuals, but even better in organisations.

Tactics vs Strategy

> Strategy gives us our destination and the path to get there

Strategy is compared with Culture.

> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. Then, like a rat, they stop in fear and freeze.

Cliched quote from Mike Tyson that has been overused, and is a variant of several quotes over the last few hundred years.

Nevertheless, it demonstrates that adaptability is important, and adaptability has to be built into a companies culture. When VUCA happens, adaptablility will save you.

Most of us were not convinced this chapter was successful in arguing this point clearly.

** emergence **

The biological concept of emergence is explained using termites as a successful example of a species with emergent behaviour. No mention is given of successful but non-adaptive species.

> Emergence occurs when the individual components of a collective are able to organize themselves into a system that is far more complicated than the sum of its parts. These systems are almost always self-organized and have incredible levels of adaptive performance.

The need to adapt to climate variability is given as a reason why humans have such large brains. This doesn't appear to be a widely accepted evolutionary theory, this bit was a bit over-cooked.

** complexity **

Three categories of company are provided, from very rigid to extremely adaptable. The most adaptable is lauded as the best choice, but this seems to contradict what was said earlier about the Ying and Yang balance of Tactics vs Strategy.

** general thoughts from the last two chapters **

We feel that salary and bonuses, considered maladaptive incentives in the book, do make us feel valued by our employers.

Wikipedia was given as a highly successful adaptive organisation with a flat structure of motivated volunteers. We wonder what tactics they use to achieve this. We appreciated that they recognised wikipedia's recent difficulties as well.

Stack overflow is an interesting parallel to wikipedia, it uses gamification to motivate people.

A trucking company uses a flat structure, and autonomous cells to make decisions, there are more examples in [Reinventing Organizations](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/).
