# Conflict without casualties

## Chapter 1: Conflict: the big bang of communication

> Conflict is energy

- People need to be very self-aware to know that discrepancy between what they want, what the situation is, and how they feel about it

> The purpose of conflict is to create
> -- Michael Meade

- Broad generalisations in the first chapter

- Famous people: did they struggle with or struggle against.... did MLK really "struggled with" for a win-win situation? or was he a rebel fighting for his beliefs?

- Two outcomes for conflict: drama and compassion

- Compassionate people handle conflict better

- NVC talks about acknowledging how the other person is feeling, even if you don't agree with it. Because everyone wants to be heard. And this is in other ways compassion.

- If conflict is not addressed, it festers and gets worse

- Practice will be useful, and will make handling conflict in the future easier. Also be prepared to take the risk, and having those conversations.

## Chapter 2: Drama, misusing the energy of conflict
