# Understanding Computation

[Understanding Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computation-Machines-Impossible-Programs-ebook/dp/B00CT3C4IM) by Tom Stuart.
  > _...learn computation theory and programming language design in an engaging, practical way. Understanding Computation explains theoretical computer science in a context you’ll recognise, helping you appreciate why these ideas matter and how they can inform your day-to-day programming._

## Chapter 1: Just Enough Ruby

_Our conversation moved through this pretty quickly as most of the group are Rubyists to some degree._

## Chapter 2: The Meaning of Programs

_There are a bunch of different ways of doing semantics: he’ll work through three._

Small-step semantics reduces the rules down to smaller and smaller steps.

Big steps felt more natural. It was about recursive instead of iterative development. The small-steps felt contrived.

_Compared to Knuth’s stuff, this is more accessible, but we still struggled. It's the first technical book we've done and 
we need to find a format that works. We've agreed to spend another week re-reading Chapter 2 and especially working through
the code to see if we can find a clearer understanding and generate more to talk about._
