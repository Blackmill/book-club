## Chapter 1
### Square squad

I'm getting clear on whose opinions matter to me. Thank you for being one of those people. I’m grateful that you care enough to be honest and real with me.

The people on your list should be the people who love you not despite your vulnerability and imperfections, but because of them.

The people on your list should not be “yes” people. This is not the suck-up squad. They should be people who respect you enough to rumble with the vulnerability

- **Myth 1: Vulnerability is weakness.**
- **Myth 2: I don’t do vulnerability.**
- **Myth 3: I can go it alone.**

  > needing no one pushes against everything we know about human neurobiology. We are hardwired for connection. From our mirror neurones to language, we are a social species. In the absence of authentic connection, we suffer. And by authentic I mean the kind of connection that doesn’t require hustling for acceptance and changing who we are to fit in.

  > don’t derive strength from our rugged individualism, but rather from our collective ability to plan, communicate, and work together.

- **Myth 4: You can engineer the uncertainty and discomfort out of vulnerability.**

  > Those fields in which systemic vulnerability is equated with failure (or worse) are often the ones in which I see people struggling the most for daring leadership skills and, interestingly, the ones in which people, once they understand, are willing to really dig deep and rumble hard.

- **Myth 5: Trust comes before vulnerability.**

  > If you’re stupid enough to let someone know where you’re tender or what you care about the most, it’s just a matter of time before someone uses that to hurt you.

  > “We trust the people who have earned marbles over time in our life. Whenever someone supports you, or is kind to you, or sticks up for you, or honors what you share with them as private, you put marbles in the jar. When people are mean, or disrespectful, or share your secrets, marbles come out. We look for the people who, over time, put marbles in, and in, and in, until you look up one day and they’re holding a full jar. Those are the folks you can tell your secrets to. Those are the folks you trust with information that’s important to you.”

  > Trust is in fact earned in the smallest of moments. It is earned not through heroic deeds, or even highly visible actions, but through paying attention, listening, and gestures of genuine care and connection.

  > Gottman’s work on marriages, he was able to predict an outcome of divorce with 90 percent accuracy based on responses to a series of questions. His team screened for what he called the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—criticism, defensiveness, stonewalling, and contempt, with contempt being the most damning in a romantic partnership.

- **Myth 6: Vulnerability is disclosure.**

I am not a proponent of oversharing, indiscriminate disclosure as a leadership tool, or vulnerability for vulnerability’s sake. There is no daring leadership without vulnerability.

Amy Edmondson on psychological safety:

> psychological safety makes it possible to give tough feedback and have difficult conversations without the need to tiptoe around the truth. In psychologically safe environments, people believe that if they make a mistake others will not penalize or think less of them for it. They also believe that others will not resent or humiliate them when they ask for help or information. This belief comes about when people both trust and respect each other, and it produces a sense of confidence that the group won’t embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up.

Things that get in the way of psychological safety in teams and groups include judgment, unsolicited advice giving, interrupting, and sharing outside the team meeting.

The behaviours that people need from their team or group almost always include listening, staying curious, being honest, and keeping confidence.

**"What does support from me look like?"** Not only does it offer the opportunity for clarity and set up the team for success, asking people for specific examples of what supportive behaviours look like—and what they do not look like—it also holds them accountable for asking for what they need.

**Maybe a better definition of vulnerability: be clear about our intention, understand the limits of vulnerability in the context of roles and relationships, and set boundaries.** Setting boundaries is making clear what’s okay and what’s not okay, and why.

Asking someone to **"say more"** often leads to profoundly deeper and more productive rumbling. Context and details matter.

Stephen Covey: "Seek first to understand, then to be understood."

We have to think about why we're sharing and, equally important, with whom. What are their roles? What is our role? Is this sharing productive and appropriate?

- Stealth intention: I can protect myself from rejection, shame, judgment, and people turning away from me and thinking I’m a bad person.
- Stealth expectation: They won’t turn away from me and think I’m a bad person.

More than occasionally, I find that the people who misrepresent my work on vulnerability and conflate it with disclosure or emotional purging either don't understand it, or they have so much personal resistance to the notion of being vulnerable that they stretch the concept until it appears ridiculous and easy to discount.

To feel is to be vulnerable. Believing that vulnerability is weakness is believing that feeling is weakness. Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, and joy.

Antonio Damasio: "We are not necessarily thinking machines. We are feeling machines that think."
