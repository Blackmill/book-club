# [Dare to Lead](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CWGFPS7/) by Brené Brown
  > _How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?_

## Introduction
> What, if anything, about the way people are leading today needs to change in order for leaders to be successful in a complex, rapidly changing environment where we’re faced with seemingly intractable challenges and an insatiable demand for innovation? There was one answer across the interviews: We need braver leaders and more courageous cultures.

Is courage a personality trait or a learnt skill?

**"What stands in the way becomes the way."**

Ten behaviours and cultural issues that leaders identified as getting in the way:

1. We avoid tough conversations, including giving honest, productive feedback.

2. Instead of proactively acknowledging and addressing the fears and feelings that show up during change and upheaval, we spend an unreasonable amount of time managing problematic behaviours.

3. Diminishing trust caused by a lack of connection and empathy.

4. Not enough people are taking smart risks or creating and sharing bold ideas to meet changing demands and the insatiable need for innovation. (Reminded of Primed to Perform requirement to adaptive behaviour.)

5. Instead of spending resources on clean-up to ensure that consumers, stakeholders, or internal processes are made whole, we are spending too much time and energy reassuring team members who are questioning their contribution and value.

6. Too much shame and blame, not enough accountability and learning.

7. People are opting out of vital conversations about diversity and inclusivity because they fear looking wrong, saying something wrong, or being wrong.
  > Choosing our own comfort over hard conversations is the epitome of privilege, and it corrodes trust and moves us away from meaningful and lasting change.

8. Rush with solutions that haven't been identified as the right one. When we fix the wrong thing for the wrong reason, the same problems continue to surface. It’s costly and demoralising.

9. Organizational values are gauzy and assessed in terms of aspirations rather than actual behaviours that can be taught, measured, and evaluated.

10. Perfectionism and fear are keeping people from learning and growing.

**Lead through discomfort**

### The heart of daring leadership

1. You can't get to courage without rumbling with vulnerability. Embrace the suck.

  - Rumbling with Vulnerability
  - Living into Our Values
  - Braving Trust
  - Learning to Rise

2. Self-awareness and self-love matter. Who we are is how we lead.

3. Courage is contagious. To scale daring leadership and build courage in teams and organisations, we have to cultivate a culture in which brave work, tough conversations, and whole hearts are the expectation, and armour is not necessary or rewarded.

**Listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard**

> so that we can innovate, solve problems, and serve people—we have to be vigilant about creating a culture in which people feel safe, seen, heard, and respected.

--

> we should never underestimate the benefit to a child of having a place to belong—even one—where they can take off their armor. It can and often does change the trajectory of their life.
>
> If the culture in our school, organization, place of worship, or even family requires armor because of issues like racism, classism, sexism, or any manifestation of fear-based leadership, we can’t expect wholehearted engagement.
> 
> Likewise, when our organization rewards armoring behaviors like blaming, shaming, cynicism, perfectionism, and emotional stoicism, we can’t expect innovative work.

## Chapter 1: 

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.
> -- Theodore Roosevelt

**Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It's having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.**

> You are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I'm not interested in or open to your feedback. There are a million cheap seats in the world today filled with people who will never be brave with their lives but who will spend every ounce of energy they have hurling advice and judgment at those who dare greatly.

--

> If you're criticizing from a place where you’re not also putting yourself on the line, I’m not interested in what you have to say.

**Get clear on whose opinions of you matter.**

We need to seek feedback from those people. And even if it's really hard to hear, we must bring it in and hold it until we learn from it.

Don't grab hurtful comments and pull them close to you by rereading them and ruminating on them. Don’t play with them by rehearsing your badass comeback. And whatever you do, don’t pull hatefulness close to your heart.

**And no matter how much your self-doubt wants to scoop up the criticism and snuggle with the negativity so it can confirm its worst fears**

**find the strength to leave what’s mean-spirited on the ground.**

### Square squad

I'm getting clear on whose opinions matter to me. Thank you for being one of those people. I’m grateful that you care enough to be honest and real with me.

The people on your list should be the people who love you not despite your vulnerability and imperfections, but because of them.

The people on your list should not be “yes” people. This is not the suck-up squad. They should be people who respect you enough to rumble with the vulnerability

- **Myth 1: Vulnerability is weakness.**
- **Myth 2: I don’t do vulnerability.**
- **Myth 3: I can go it alone.**

  > needing no one pushes against everything we know about human neurobiology. We are hardwired for connection. From our mirror neurones to language, we are a social species. In the absence of authentic connection, we suffer. And by authentic I mean the kind of connection that doesn’t require hustling for acceptance and changing who we are to fit in.

  > don’t derive strength from our rugged individualism, but rather from our collective ability to plan, communicate, and work together.

- **Myth 4: You can engineer the uncertainty and discomfort out of vulnerability.**

  > Those fields in which systemic vulnerability is equated with failure (or worse) are often the ones in which I see people struggling the most for daring leadership skills and, interestingly, the ones in which people, once they understand, are willing to really dig deep and rumble hard.

- **Myth 5: Trust comes before vulnerability.**

  > If you’re stupid enough to let someone know where you’re tender or what you care about the most, it’s just a matter of time before someone uses that to hurt you.

  > “We trust the people who have earned marbles over time in our life. Whenever someone supports you, or is kind to you, or sticks up for you, or honors what you share with them as private, you put marbles in the jar. When people are mean, or disrespectful, or share your secrets, marbles come out. We look for the people who, over time, put marbles in, and in, and in, until you look up one day and they’re holding a full jar. Those are the folks you can tell your secrets to. Those are the folks you trust with information that’s important to you.”

  > Trust is in fact earned in the smallest of moments. It is earned not through heroic deeds, or even highly visible actions, but through paying attention, listening, and gestures of genuine care and connection.

  > Gottman’s work on marriages, he was able to predict an outcome of divorce with 90 percent accuracy based on responses to a series of questions. His team screened for what he called the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—criticism, defensiveness, stonewalling, and contempt, with contempt being the most damning in a romantic partnership.

- **Myth 6: Vulnerability is disclosure.**

I am not a proponent of oversharing, indiscriminate disclosure as a leadership tool, or vulnerability for vulnerability’s sake. There is no daring leadership without vulnerability.

Amy Edmondson on psychological safety:

> psychological safety makes it possible to give tough feedback and have difficult conversations without the need to tiptoe around the truth. In psychologically safe environments, people believe that if they make a mistake others will not penalize or think less of them for it. They also believe that others will not resent or humiliate them when they ask for help or information. This belief comes about when people both trust and respect each other, and it produces a sense of confidence that the group won’t embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up.

Things that get in the way of psychological safety in teams and groups include judgment, unsolicited advice giving, interrupting, and sharing outside the team meeting.

The behaviours that people need from their team or group almost always include listening, staying curious, being honest, and keeping confidence.

**"What does support from me look like?"** Not only does it offer the opportunity for clarity and set up the team for success, asking people for specific examples of what supportive behaviours look like—and what they do not look like—it also holds them accountable for asking for what they need.

**Maybe a better definition of vulnerability: be clear about our intention, understand the limits of vulnerability in the context of roles and relationships, and set boundaries.** Setting boundaries is making clear what’s okay and what’s not okay, and why.

Asking someone to **"say more"** often leads to profoundly deeper and more productive rumbling. Context and details matter.

Stephen Covey: "Seek first to understand, then to be understood."

We have to think about why we're sharing and, equally important, with whom. What are their roles? What is our role? Is this sharing productive and appropriate?

- Stealth intention: I can protect myself from rejection, shame, judgment, and people turning away from me and thinking I’m a bad person.
- Stealth expectation: They won’t turn away from me and think I’m a bad person.

More than occasionally, I find that the people who misrepresent my work on vulnerability and conflate it with disclosure or emotional purging either don't understand it, or they have so much personal resistance to the notion of being vulnerable that they stretch the concept until it appears ridiculous and easy to discount.

To feel is to be vulnerable. Believing that vulnerability is weakness is believing that feeling is weakness. Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, and joy.

Antonio Damasio: "We are not necessarily thinking machines. We are feeling machines that think."

## Chapter 2: the call to courage

Meta discussion on language in the book:

- Teaching via stories
- Repetitive "rumble" and "this was in my previous book"
- Possibly "smug tone" rather than "learning with us"
- Using named phrases and keywords
- No references to research sources even though the book claims to be based on science

**Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind.**

> Not getting clear with a colleague about your expectations because it feels too hard, yet holding them accountable or blaming them for not delivering is unkind. Talking about people rather than to them is unkind.

Being clear when giving feedback should take into consideration not hijacking the other person's amygdala.
Rumble style talks about using vulnerability to build trust.

"Trust batteries"

From "I'm not enough" to "this is their fault" is not that far.
Trying to get people to push through those feelings and anger, and step away to reflect is usually useful instead of immediately putting up armour.

#### Permission slips

> We each wrote down one thing that we gave ourselves permission to do or feel for this meeting... for stating and writing down intentions only, so there are no repercussions if you fail to deliver; however, they are useful for increasing accountability and the potential for support, and also for understanding where everyone in the room is coming from.

Similar to "check-ins" at the start of a meeting, but instead of communicating that to the rest of the team, it is personal, with might need to be very self-aware to be able to do that.

#### Turn and learn for work estimates

Similar to card estimations, and even with team discussion on unknowns and possible complexities, these discussions are still very poor at estimating work and how long it will take.

However it helps to get people on the same page by communicating what else is happening. Which is the same with agreeing on meeting minutes.

#### New meeting minutes process

> Everyone takes their own notes, but one person in the meeting volunteers to capture minutes. These are narrowed down to:

- Date
- Meeting intention
- Attendees
- Key decisions
- Tasks and ownership

> We now stop meetings five minutes early to review and agree on the minutes before we leave.

Getting out of meeting with different ideas of what should be done happens. So the above can be very useful.

#### Binary thinking

> This type of binary thinking is very dangerous because we're not leveraging the fullness of people. The roles become caricatures and stereotypes

#### How to apologise: core value for leadership

> While some leaders consider apologising to be a sign of weakness, we teach it as a skill and frame the willingness to apologise and make amends as brave leadership.

#### Mental health and loneliness

Possibly another example of being clear with the chosen wording, for example using "lonely" rather than "disconnect". On theme with "clear is kind".

> Leaders must either invest a reasonable amount of time attending to fears and feelings, or squander an unreasonable amount of time trying to manage ineffective and unproductive behaviour.

#### Making space for conversation

You as the leader by your choice of words, clarity, and being vulnerable, can create space for deeper conversations.

> After the third one-on-one addressing the same issue, it's easy to make up the story that this person is just being difficult or even testing us. But what I've found in my own experience is that we haven't gone deep enough. We haven't peeled away enough layers of the onion. And once we start peeling, **we have to leave long pauses and empty space. I know the conversation is hard enough, but people need white space.** Stop talking. Even if it's awkward—which it will be the first fifteen times.

--
> And when they start talking (which they normally will), listen. Really listen. Don't formulate your response while they're talking. If you have a great insight—hold it. Don't do that thing where the listener starts nodding faster and faster, not because they're actively listening but because they're trying to unconsciously signal the talker to wrap up so they can talk. **Keep a lot of space in the conversation.**

#### Setting boundaries

They're allowed to be pissed or sad or surprised or elated. But if their behaviours are not okay, we set the boundaries:

- I know this is a tough conversation. Being angry is okay. Yelling is not okay.
- I know we're tired and stressed. This has been a long meeting. Being frustrated is okay. Interrupting people and rolling your eyes is not okay.
- I appreciate the passion around these different opinions and ideas. The emotion is okay. Passive-aggressive comments and put-downs are not okay.

#### Time outs

> Sometimes a team member will say, "I need time to think about what I'm hearing. Can we take an hour and circle back after lunch?" I really appreciate that because it leads to better decision making. And giving people a reasonable amount of thinking time cuts down on the meeting-after-the-meeting and back-channeling behaviours, which are both outside what’s okay in our culture.

--
> ...we can't do our jobs when we own other people’s emotions or take responsibility for them as a way to control the related behaviours, for one simple reason: Other people's emotions are not our jobs. We can't both serve people and try to control their feelings.

*Where is the line between being brave or being arrogant? How do you balance it?*
