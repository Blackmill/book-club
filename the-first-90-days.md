# The first 90 days

## Intro

> You’re managing under a microscope, subject to a high degree of scrutiny as people around you strive to figure out who you are and what you represent as a leader. Opinions of your effectiveness begin to form surprisingly quickly, and, once formed, they’re very hard to change. If you’re successful in building credibility and securing early wins, the momentum likely will propel you through the rest of your tenure. But if you dig yourself into a hole early on, you will face an uphill battle from that point forward.

- Transitions into new roles are the most challenging times in the professional lives of leaders
- Success or failure during the first few months is a strong predictor of overall success or failure in the job
- Leaders average a major transition every 1.3 years
  - Each year about a quarter of managers in a Fortune 500 company change jobs
You goal is to reach the break-even point as rapidly as possible

### Reaching the breakpoint even

- “Break-even point”: the point in which you have contributed as much value to the new organization as you have consumed from it
- Usually 6.2 months for midlevel hired from the outside
- If you inherited a disaster -> maybe could see value from the start
- If outside hire into a successful org -> longer to see net value

### Transition traps

- Sticking with what you know
- Falling prey to the action imperative
- Setting unrealistic expectations
- Attempting to do too much
- Coming in with "the" answer
- Engaging in the wrong type of learning
- Neglecting horizontal relationships

Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.

### Fundamental principles

- Prepare yourself
- Accelerate your learning
- Match your strategy to the situation
- Secure early wins
- Negotiate success
- Achieve alignment
- Build your team
- Create coalitions
- Keep your balance
- Accelerate everyone

### Transition risk assessment and mapping out the first 90 days

- Spend time learning about the organisation
- Start planning what your want to accomplish and by when
- Identify the risks you face

### Acceleration checklist

1. What will it take for you to reach the break-even point more quickly?
2. What are some traps you might encounter, and how can you avoid them?
3. What can you do to create virtuous cycles and build momentum in your new role?
4. What types of transitions are you experiencing? Which are you finding most challenging, and why?
5. What are the key elements and milestones in your 90-day plan?

## 1: prepare yourself

- It is a mistake to believe that you will be successful in your new job by continuing to do what you did in your previous job, only more so
- Prepare yourself for the new position: let go of the past, embrace the imperatives of the new situation
- Two key transitions, each with each own challenges are:
  - Being promoted
  - Onboarding into a new company

### Four pillars of effective onboarding

- Business orientation (learn about the company as a whole, not just your specific parts)
- Stakeholder connection (vertical and horizontal). Find people to tell you the back story
- Expectations alignment
- Cultural adaptation (determine the norms, shared language, values, etc.)
  - Key check list includes: influence, meetings, execution, conflict, recognition, ends versus means.

### Key ways to prepare yourself

- When transitioning, take time to make a clear break from the old and the new 
- Assess your vulnerabilities
- Watch out for your strengths
- Relearn how to learn (learn how to “unlearn”)
- Rework your network
- Watch out for people who want to hold you back
- Get some help

### Checklist

1. If you have been promoted, what are the implications for your need to balance breadth and depth, delegate, influence, communicate, and exhibit leadership presence?
2. If you are joining a new organisation, how will you orient yourself to the business, identify and connect with key stakeholders, clarify expectations, and adapt to the new culture? What is the right balance between adapting to the new situation and trying to alter it?
3. What has made you successful so far in your career? Can you succeed in your new position by relying solely on those strengths? If not, what are the critical skills you need to develop?
4. Are there aspects of your new job that are critical to success but that you prefer not to focus on? Why? How will you compensate for your potential blind spots?
5. How can you ensure that you make the mental leap into the new position? From whom might you seek advice and counsel on this? What other activities might help you do this?

## 2: Accelerate your learning

- Baseline question: how did we get here?
- The pressure to do almost always comes from within rather than outside forces
- Simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand -> credibility and influence
- Coming in with the answer alienates people
- Learning agenda: learn about the past, present, and future
  - Past: performance, root causes, history of change
  - Present: vision and strategy, people, processes, land mines, early wins
  - Future: challenges and opportunities, barriers and resources, culture
- Identify who you can learn from the most -- from within and outside the organisation
- Structured learning methods: ask the same five Qs:
  1. What are the biggest challenges the organisation is facing (or will face in the near future)?
  1. Why is the organisation facing (or going to face) these challenges?
  1. What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?
  1. What would need to happen for the organisation to exploit the potential of these opportunities?
  1. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?
- Once you gathered insights, observations, and questions, gather the team, share your thoughts and invite a discussion. This will teach you about substance and team dynamics.
- Methods for learning:
  - surveys
  - interviews
  - focus groups
  - analysis of critical past decisions
  - process analysis
  - tours
  - pilot projects
- Learning plan template!

### Checklist

1. How effective are you at learning about new organisations? Do you sometimes fall prey to the action imperative? To coming in with “the” answer? If so, how will you avoid doing this?
2. What is your learning agenda? Based on what you know now, compose a list of questions to guide your early enquiries. If you have begun to form hypotheses about what is going on, what are they, and how will you test them?
3. Given the questions you want to answer, who is likely to provide you with the most useful insights?
4. How might you increase the efficiency of your learning process? What are some structured ways you might extract more insight for your investment of time and energy?
5. What support is available to accelerate your learning, and how might you best leverage it?
6. Given your answers to the previous questions, start to create your learning plan.

## 3: Match strategy to situation

- Questions for leaders:
  - What kind of change am I being called upon to lead? -> to be able to match strategy to situation
  - What kind of change leader am I? -> how do I adjust my leadership style

### STARS model

- Startup - assembling new business initiative
- Turnaround - saving a business in trouble
- Accelerate growth - managing rapidly expanding business
- Re-alignment - re-energising a previously successful organisation
- Sustaining success - taking a successful business to the next level

> You cannot figure out where to take a new organisation if you do not understand where it has been and how it got where it is.

### Leading change

- Diagnose which parts of the organisation are in which stage -> this exercise will help you think systematically about challenges and opportunities
- Take each part of the business and categorise it with STARS situation,  priority percentage, and challenges and opportunities

> Specifically, you must establish priorities, define strategic intent, identify where you can secure early wins, build the right leadership team, and create supporting alliances.

### Turnarounds vs re-alignments

- Organise to learn
  - T: focus on technical learning, prepare to act quickly
  - R: Focus on **cultural and political** learning, prepare to act deliberately
- Define strategic intent:
  - T: prune non-core business
  - R: leverage existing capabilities. Stimulate innovation
- Establish priorities:
  - T: fast, bold moves, focus on strategy and structure
  - R: slow, deliberate moves, focus on systems, skills, and **culture**
- Build the leadership team:
  - T: clean house at the top, recruit external talent
  - R: few big changes, promote potential from within
- Secure early wins:
  - T: shift organisational mindset from despair to hope
  - R: shift organisational mindset from denial to awareness (like learning metrics)
- Creating supporting alliances:
  - T: gain stakeholders support to invest in the required resources
  - R: build alliances sideways and down to ensure better execution
- Leadership style:
  - T: hopeful, hero
  - R: steward, servant leader, more diplomatic, ego-less approach

### Checklist

1. What portfolio of STARS situations have you inherited? Which portions of your responsibilities are in start-up, turnaround, accelerated-growth, realignment, and sustaining-success modes?
2. What are the implications for the challenges and opportunities you are likely to confront, and for the way you should approach accelerating your transition?
3. What are the implications for your learning agenda? Do you need to understand only the technical side of the business, or is it critical that you understand culture and politics as well?
4. What is the prevailing climate in your organisation? What psychological transformations do you need to make, and how will you bring them about?
5. How can you best lead change given the situations you face?
6. Which of your skills and strengths are likely to be most valuable in your new situation, and which have the potential to get you into trouble?
7. What are the implications for the team you need to build?

## 4: Negotiate success
- Clearly communicate a 90 day plan
- Proactively engage with your new boss to shape the game so that you have a fighting chance of achieving desired goals
- Establish realistic expectations
- Establish a relationship with your boss
  - Don't stay away
  - Don't surprise your boss
  - Don't approach your boss only with problems
  - Don’t run down your checklist with your boss, have at most 3 things
  - Don't expect your boss to change
  - Do clarify expectations early and often
  - Take responsibility for the relationship with your boss
  - Negotiate timelines
  - Figure out what your boss cares about most
  - E.g. “What are three things that are important to you?”
  - Determine your boss’s working style
- Under promise and over deliver - aim for early wins in areas that are important for your boss
- “What exactly do I need from my boss?”
- After 90 days, discuss how I am doing

### Planning for 5 conversations

1. Situational diagnosis conversation - how does your boss see things
2. Expectations conversation - understand and negotiate expectations
3. Resource conversation - resources negotiations, what do you need to be successful?
  - Focus on underlying interests
  - Look for mutually beneficial exchanges
  - Link resources to results
4. Style conversation - how do you work together
5. Personal development conversation - what your development priorities should be?

Use these conversations to set goals for the next 30 days.

> Helping direct reports accelerate their transitions is about more than being a good manager and contributing to others’ development. The faster your direct reports get up to speed, the better able they will be to help you reach your goals.

### Checklist
1. How effectively have you built relationships with new bosses in the past? What have you done well? Where do you need improvement?
2. Create a plan for the situational conversation. Based on what you know now, what issues will you raise with your boss in this conversation? What do you want to say up front? In what order do you want to raise issues?
3. Create a plan for the expectations conversation. How will you figure out what your new boss expects you to do?
4. Create a plan for the style conversation. How will you figure out how best to work with your boss? What mode of communication does he prefer? How often should you interact? How much detail should you provide? What types of issues should you consult with him about before deciding?
5. Create a plan for the resource conversation. Given what you need to do, what resources are absolutely needed? With fewer resources, what would you have to forgo? If you had more resources, what would the benefits be? Be sure to build the business case.
6. Create a plan for the personal development conversation. What are your strengths, and where do you need improvement? What kinds of assignments or projects might help you develop skills you need?
7. How might you use the five conversations framework to accelerate the development of your team? Where are you in terms of having the key conversations with each of your direct reports? 

## 5: Secure early wins

- Don't change too many things too quickly
- Early wins to build personal credibility - try for that in the first 30 days
- Making waves of change: learning, designing the changes, building support, implementing the changes, observing results
- Start with the goal in mind
  - Focus on business priorities
  - Identify unwanted behaviours -> support behavioural changes.
    Examples: lack of focus (unclear priorities, putting out fires), discipline (QA, performance, inconsistency), innovation (slow, non existent), teamwork (compete, cliques), complacency
- Basic principles for wins
  - Focus on a few promising opportunities
  - Get wins that matter to your boss
  - Get wins in the right ways - don't cut corners
  - Take STARS portfolio into account
  - Adjust for the culture - understand what is and is not viewed as a win
- What to do first
  - Build credibility
  - Decide which project to launch
- People will form opinions on you with very little data
- Leading former peers
  - Accept that relationships must change
  - Focus on establishing yourself in the new role - for example new boss introducing you
  - Recognise disappointment competitors and figure out who can work for you and who can't
  - Establish your authority, maybe adopt a consult-and-decide approach
  - Focus on what's good for the business

> Your credibility, or lack of it, will depend on how people would answer the following questions about you:
> 
> 1. Do you have the insight and steadiness to make tough decisions?
> 2. Do you have values that they relate to, admire, and want to emulate?
> 3. Do you have the right kind of energy?
> 4. Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others?
 
- Credible leaders:
  - Demanding but able to be satisfied
  - Accessible but not too familiar
  - Decisive but judicious
  - Focused but flexible
  - Active without causing commotion
  - Willing to make tough calls, but humane
- When you start, think about how you wish to communicate: what messages?, how will you engage and connect?
- Early wins: best are problems you can
  - tackle quickly,
  - with modest expenditure, and
  - will yield visible operational and financial gain
- Align your learning agenda with early wins

### FOGLAMP project checklist

> **Focus:** What is the focus for this project? For example, what goal or early win do you want to achieve?  
> **Oversight:** How will you oversee this project? Who else should participate in oversight to help you get buy-in for implementing results?  
> **Goals:** What are the goals and the intermediate milestones, and time frames for achieving them? Leadership: Who will lead the project? What training, if any, do they need in order to be successful?  
> **Abilities:** What mix of skills and representation needs to be included? Who needs to be included because of their skills? Because they represent key constituencies?  
> **Means:** What additional resources, such as facilitation, does the team need to be successful?  
> **Process:** Are there change models or structured processes you want the team to use? If so, how will they become familiar with the approach?

### Leading change
> **Awareness**. A critical mass of people is aware of the need for change.  
> **Diagnosis**. You know what needs to be changed and why.  
> **Vision**. You have a compelling vision and a solid strategy.  
> **Plan**. You have the expertise to put together a detailed plan.  
> **Support**. You have sufficiently powerful alliances to support implementation.

### Behavioural change
- You cannot through away the culture

> The key is to identify both the good and the bad elements of the existing culture. Elevate and praise the good elements even as you seek to change the bad ones. These functional aspects of the familiar culture are a bridge that can help carry people from the past to the future.

- Match strategy to situation
- Avoid predictable surprises. Ask about the external environment, customers, markets, competitors, and strategy, internal capabilities, organisational politics

### Checklist
1. Given your agreed-to business goals, what do you need to do during your transition to create momentum for achieving them?
2. How do people need to behave differently to achieve these goals? Describe as vividly as you can the behaviours you need to encourage and those you need to discourage.
3. How do you plan to connect yourself to your new organisation? Who are your key audiences, and what messages would you like to convey to them? What are the best modes of engagement?
4. What are the most promising focal points to get some early improvements in performance and start the process of behaviour change?
5. What projects do you need to launch, and who will lead them?
6. What predictable surprises could take you off track?

## 6: Achieve Alignment

> But Hannah knew that the people issues couldn’t be dealt with until the structure was put right.

--
> The higher you climb in organizations, the more you take on the role of organizational architect, creating and aligning the key elements of the organizational system: the strategic direction, structure, core processes, and skill bases that provide the foundation for superior performance.

--
> If you have the scope to alter **direction, structure, processes, and skills** in your new position, you should begin to analyze the architecture of your organization and assess alignment among these key elements.

Otherwise, just focus on alignment

### Avoiding common traps
- Making changes for change's sake
- Not adjusting for the STARS situation - instead of a "one size fits all"
- Trying to restructure your way out fo deeper problems - better of to understand root causes of problems
- Creating structures that are too complex - strive for clear lines of responsibility
- Overestimating your organisation's capacity to absorb change - incremental change is better

What is a matrix structure??

### Designing organisational architecture
You need alignment on

- Strategic direction - mission, vision, and strategy
- Structure - work units, how work is measured and incentivised
- Core processes - systems that add value
- Skill bases - capabilities of the people in the org

Changing one, will probably require alignment in the other three as well

### Getting started

> First, you need to be clear on whether your destination (the mission and goals) and your route (the strategy) are the right ones. Then you can figure out which boat you need (the structure), how to outfit it (the processes), and which mix of crew members is best (the skill bases).

1. Begin with strategic direction
2. Look at supporting structure, processes, and skills
3. Decide how and when you will introduce the new strategic direction
4. Think through the correct sequencing - approach
5. Close the loop

### Strategic direction

> Mission is about what will be achieved, vision is about why people should feel motivated to perform at a high level, and strategy is about how resources should be allocated and decisions made to accomplish the mission.

**Focus on 4Cs**:

- Customers - who to serve? what is our value proposition? which markets to exit? what new markets to enter?
- Capital - where is cash coming from? where else can we acquire capital and when?
- Capabilities - what are we good and not good at? what capabilities can we leverage? which do we need to build up, create, or acquire?
- Commitments - resourcing

Review existing docs and disassemble into the above four components. Do they support each other? is there a connecting logical thread? What plans are already in place?

**TOWS**

Identify potential threats and opportunities before considering your strengths and weaknesses... Learn how the strategy was defined

> Does the organization have weaknesses that make it particularly vulnerable to specific threats? Does the organization have strengths that would permit it to pursue specific opportunities? ... Translate these assessments into a set of strategic priorities

### Elements of structure

1. Units - teams by function, product, geographical area
2. Reporting lines - accountability and effort coordination between the teams
3. Decision rights and rules - who is empowered to make decisions?
4. Performance measurement and incentive systems

### Core processes (systems)

> Core processes (often referred to as “systems”) enable your group to transform information, materials, and knowledge into value in the form of commercially viable products or services, new knowledge or ideas, productive relationships, or anything else the larger organization considers essential. Again, as with structure, ask yourself whether the processes currently in place support your mission, vision, and strategy.

Evaluate:

1. Productivity - does the process transform knowledge, materials, and labour into value?
2. Timeliness - in a timely manner?
3. Reliability - does the process break down?
4. Quality - does it meet quality standards?

### Develop skill bases

Four types of knowledge:

1. Individual expertise - gained through training, education, and experience
2. Relational knowledge - understanding of relationships that shape collaborations
3. Embedded knowledge - core technologies and systems
4. Meta-knowledge - knowing where to go to get critical information

Goal: identify knowledge gaps

### Changing architecture to change culture

Culture is influenced by the four elements of organisational architecture, as well as by leadership behaviours. To achieve cultural change, we need to change the architecture and reinforce it with leadership.

### Checklist

1. What are your observations about misalignments among strategic direction, structure, processes, and skills? How will you dig deeper to confirm or refine your impressions?
2. What decisions about customers, capital, capabilities, and commitments do you need to make? How and when will you make these decisions?
3. What is your current assessment of the coherence of the organisation’s strategic direction? Of its adequacy? What are your current thoughts about changing direction?
4. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation’s structure? What potential structural changes are you thinking about?
5. What are the core processes in your organisation? How well are they performing? What are your priorities for process improvement?
6. What skill gaps and underutilised resources have you identified? What are your priorities for strengthening key skill bases?

## 7: Build your team

### Avoiding common traps

1. Criticising previous leadership
2. Keep people for too long
3. Don't change too many things too quickly
4. Not working on organisational alignment and team development in parallel
5. Not holding on to good people
6. Undertake team building activities before the team is complete
7. Make decisions too early
8. Trying to do it all by yourself - get support from HR

### Assessing the team

Assess who is who in the first 30-60 days, team members roles, and how the team worked in the past. Start by establishing an **evaluation criteria**:

1. Competence - technical competence and knowledge?
2. Judgement - exercise good judgement? especially under pressure?
3. Energy - right kind of energy? or burnt out? disengaged?
4. Focus - capable of setting priorities and sticking to them?
5. Relationships - collaborative?
6. Trust - trustworthy and follow through on commitments?

> If you’re entering an enterprise leader role, consider developing your own templates for evaluating people in functions such as marketing, sales, finance, and operations. **A good template includes function-specific key performance indicators (KPIs), what the KPIs should and should not show, key questions to ask, and warning signs**.

Additionally:

1. Remember to check your assumptions.
2. Factor in extent of teamwork
3. factor in the STARS mix
4. Factor in how critical these positions are
5. Have 1:1 with your new team
6. Assess the team as a whole

> One way to assess judgment is to work with a person for an extended time and observe whether he is able to (1) make sound predictions and (2) develop good strategies for avoiding problems.

### Evolving the team

After 30 days, decide:

1. Keep in place
2. Keep and develop
3. Move to another position
4. Replace (low priority)
5. Replace (high priority)
6. Observe for a while

Also, consider alternatives, develop backups, and treat people respectfully

### Aligning the team

Motivate using a blend of push and pull tools:

- Push tools, such as goals, performance measurement systems, and incentives, motivate people through authority, loyalty, fear, and expectation of reward for productive work.
- Pull tools, such as a compelling vision, inspire people by invoking a positive and exciting image of the future.

### Off-site planning checklist

Reasons for an off-site:

- To gain a shared understanding of the business - diagnostic focus
- To define the vision and create a strategy - strategy focus
- To change the way the team works together - team process focus
- To build or alter relationships in the group - relationship focus
- To develop a plan and commit to achieving it - planning focus
- To address conflicts and negotiate agreements - conflict resolution focus

Logistics:

- When and where?
- What will be dealt with? and in what order?
- Who will be the facilitator?

Don't try to do too much. Not too many targets, stay focused.
And ensure there is a shared understanding of the business environment and workplace relationship before you can define vision or create a strategy 

### Decision making

- Highly divisive—creating winners and losers—then  -> consult-and-decide and taking the heat. A build-consensus process will fail to reach a good outcome and will get everyone mad at one another in the process.
- If the decision requires energetic support for implementation from people whose performance you cannot adequately observe and control -> build-consensus
- If inexperienced team members -> consult and decide
- If you need to establish authority -> consult and decide

> To avoid confusion, consider explaining to your direct reports what process you’re using and why. More importantly, strive to run a fair process.4 Even if people do not agree with the final decision, they often will support it if they feel (1) that their views and interests have been heard and taken seriously and (2) that you have given them a plausible rationale for why you made the call you did. The corollary? Don’t engage in a charade of consensus building—an effort to build support for a decision already made. This rarely fools anyone, and it creates cynicism...

### Virtual teams

Additional things to consider;

1. Get people together early
2. Establish clear norms about communication
3. Clearly define team support roles - for example note taker 
4. Create a rhythm for team interaction - routines. Provide structure for interactions
5. Don't forget to celebrate success

> You will know you’ve been successful in building your team when you reach the break-even point—when the energy the team creates is greater than the energy you need to put into it.

### Checklist

1. What are your criteria for assessing the performance of members of your team? How are relative weightings affected by functions, the extent of required teamwork, the STARS portfolio, and the criticality of the positions?
2. How will you go about assessing your team?
3. What personnel changes do you need to make? Which changes are urgent, and which can wait? How will you create backups and options?
4. How will you make high-priority changes? What can you do to preserve the dignity of the people affected? What help will you need with the team in the restructuring process, and where are you going to find it?
5. How will you align the team? What mix of push (goals, incentives) and pull (shared vision) will you use?
6. How do you want your new team to operate? What roles do you want people to play? Do you need to shrink the core team or expand it? How do you plan to manage decision making?

## 8: create alliances

> To succeed in your new role, you will need the support of people over whom you have no direct authority.

- Consider the people who are likely be critical to your success
- Define influence objectives - whose support do I need?
- Win and block alliances
- Map influence networks - and why can they influence? is it
  - Expertise
  - Control of information
  - Connections to others
  - Access to resources
  - Personal loyalty
- Reasons why resistance might happen:
  - Comfort with the status quo
  - Fear of looking incompetent
  - Threats to core values
  - Threats to their power
  - Negative consequences for their allies
- People that still need to be persuaded. They might be:
  - Indifferent
  - Undecided
  - Political operators waiting to see which way the wind will blow
- Understand pivotal people

> Start by assessing their intrinsic motivators. People are motivated by various things, such as a need for recognition, for control, for power, for affiliation through relationships with colleagues, and for personal growth

- Craft influence strategies
  - Consultation promotes buy-in
  - Framing - craft personal messages. Frame arguments with logos (logical data), ethos (principles and values), and pathos (emotional connections) in mind
  - Choice shaping - affect how people perceive their alternatives
  - Social influence - avoid asking people to make choices that are inconsistent with their values, prior commitments, decrease their status, threaten their reputation or risk disapproval by others
  - Incrementalism - small steps rather than a single big leap
  - Sequencing - approach the right people first
  - Action-forcing events - eliminate inaction as an option to avoid delays

### Checklist
1. What are the critical alliances you need to build—both within your organisation and externally—to advance your agenda?
2. What agendas are other key players pursuing? Where might they align with yours, and where might they come into conflict?
3. Are there opportunities to build long-term, broad-based alliances with others? Where might you be able to leverage shorter-term agreements to pursue specific objectives?
4. How does influence work in the organisation? Who defers to whom on key issues of concern?
5. Who is likely to support your agenda? Who is likely to oppose you? Who is persuadable?
6. What are the motivations of pivotal people, the situational pressures acting on them, and their perceptions of their choices?
7. What are the elements of an effective influence strategy? How should you frame your arguments? Might influence tools such as incrementalism, sequencing, and action-forcing events help?

## 9: Manage yourself

- Guidelines for structured reflection
  - How do you feel so far? excited? confident? in control?
  - What has bothered you so far? with whom have you failed to connect? and why? meetings?
  - What has gone well? or poorly?
- Potentially dysfunctional behaviours that lead to stress
  - Unclear boundaries
  - Brittleness
  - Isolation
  - Work avoidance
- Three pillars of self management
  - Adopt 90-day strategies
  - Create and enforce personal disciplines
      - Plan
      - Focus on the important
      - Learn to say no - rather than commit on the spur of the moment
      - Stand back from emotional situations
      - Check in with yourself - are you aware of your reactions?
      - Recognise when to quit
  - Form support systems - at work and at home to help maintain balance
      - You cannot be productive at work if home is falling apart
      - You can't do it alone. It leads to isolation and losing perspective. Find technical advisors, cultural interpreters, and political counsellors. Consider internal and external advisers.


### Checklist

1. What are your greatest vulnerabilities in your new role? How do you plan to compensate for them?
2. What personal disciplines do you most need to develop or enhance? How will you do that? What will success look like?
3. What can you do to gain more control over your local environment?
4. What can you do to ease your family’s transition? What support relationships will you have to build? Which are your highest priorities?
5. What are your priorities for strengthening your advice-and-counsel network? To what extent do you need to focus on your internal network? Your external network? In which domain do you most need additional support—technical, cultural, political, or personal?

## 10: Accelerate everyone

> It’s even a potential source of competitive advantage; if you can help everyone get up to speed faster, the business will be more nimble and responsive.

### Checklist
1. What are the most important transitions in your organisation, and how often do they occur?
2. Is the organisation able to identify where and when transitions are occurring?
3. Is there a common core transition acceleration framework, language, and toolkit?
4. Do leaders have the support they need, when they need it, and throughout their transitions? What could be done to provide focused resources for onboarding and promotion transitions?
5. Are the company’s systems for recruiting and accelerating transitions linked in appropriate ways?
6. Should transition acceleration be part of your organisation’s curriculum for developing high-potential leaders?
7. How might the 90-day framework be used to accelerate organisational change—for example, restructuring or post-acquisition integration?
