Book club weekly notes

This is an open book club. You don't need to work at Blackmill or be a client.
You don't even need to know us!
If the current book interests you, do the reading,
and jump on Whereby at the right time to have a friendly conversation.
Hopefully we'll all learn something from the book and each other.

You can see where we're up to in the issues: https://github.com/Blackmill/book-club/issues

See you Wednesdays, at 12pm Melbourne time: https://whereby.com/blackmill
