Book club weekly notes

This is an open book club. You don't need to work at Blackmill or be a client. You don't even need to know us! If the current book interests you, do the reading and jump on Whereby at the right time to have a friendly conversation. Hopefully we'll all learn something from the book and each other.

The current book is [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) by Daniel Kahneman.
  > _The central thesis is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion._.
