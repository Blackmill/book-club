Book club weekly notes

This is an open book club. You don't need to work at Blackmill or be a client. You don't even need to know us! If the current book interests you, do the reading and jump on Zoom at the right time to have a friendly conversation. Hopefully we'll all learn something from the book and each other.

The current book is *[Conflict Without Casualties](https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-without-Casualties-Compassionate-Accountability-ebook/dp/B01N4RE97O/): a field guide for leading with compassionate accountability*. You can see where we're up to in the issues: https://github.com/Blackmill/book-club/labels/conflict-without-casualties
