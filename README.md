Book club weekly notes

This is an open book club. You don't need to work at Blackmill or be a client. You don't even need to know us! If the current book interests you, do the reading and jump on Zoom at the right time to have a friendly conversation. Hopefully we'll all learn something from the book and each other.

The current book is *[Primed to Perform](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S590OQI/): How to Build the Highest Performing Cultures Through the Science of Total Motivation*. You can see where we're up to in the issues: https://github.com/Blackmill/book-club/labels/primed-to-perform


See you Tuesday: https://whereby.com/blackmill
