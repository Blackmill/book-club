Book club weekly notes

This is an open book club. You don't need to work at Blackmill or be a client. You don't even need to know us! If the current book interests you, do the reading and jump on Whereby at the right time to have a friendly conversation. Hopefully we'll all learn something from the book and each other.

Our next book is [The Making of a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness-ebook/dp/B00A5DCALY/) by 
Julie Zhuo

We're [starting it March 9th](https://github.com/Blackmill/book-club/issues/105).
  
You can see where we're up to in the issues: https://github.com/Blackmill/book-club/issues

See you Tuesdays, at 12pm Melbourne time: https://whereby.com/blackmill
