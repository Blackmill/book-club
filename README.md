Book club weekly notes

This is an open book club. You don't need to work at Blackmill or be a client. You don't even need to know us! If the current book interests you, do the reading and jump on Whereby at the right time to have a friendly conversation. Hopefully we'll all learn something from the book and each other.

The current book is [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition) by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt.
> For twenty years, the lessons from The Pragmatic Programmer have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology. This classic title is regularly featured on “Top Ten” lists, and many corporations issue it to their new hires._
>
> This new 20th Anniversary Edition offers a fresh look at the modern development landscape, cutting through the “business as usual” and tired advice from the net to help guide you through the next twenty years and beyond. Featuring new tips, new topics, and revisions throughout, you don’t want to miss this one.
