# The Manager's Path

# JAN 22

## 1: Management 101

### What to expect from a manager

**Personal experience: what made them good managers:**

- Understanding the work to be done and the constraints on it
- Strong vision to put across to the team, and made clear what your role is on that team
- Not micro-managers and allow people to make their own mistakes, and gave support as needed
- Trusted and be apart of something bigger
- People's managers
- Shielded the team from demanding product owners and account managers

Camille talks more about day to day routines:

- 1:1 meetings - congratulate or deal with issues regularly
- Feedback and workplace guidance
- Training and career growth

Mentioned by Michael: [Office Vibe](https://www.officevibe.com)

### How to be managed

- What do you want
- Be responsible for yourself
- Choose your manager
- Interview the management
- If you plan to do your own thing, choose a workplace
  that has a track record of people that started on their own.

## Mini retro

- Technical: work through the examples
- Non-technical: usually just have a discussion around the topic
- Use GitHub for notes, and make a GH issue for the next meeting
  so that people can add notes/comments/questions to help with the agenda
- Be more prepared!
- Better way to RSVP ??

## 2: Mentoring

**Three types of mentoring:**

- Interns
- New hires
- Technical or career mentoring

### Camille's tips

- Don't disappear
- Listen carefully
- Communicate clearly
- Calibrate your responses
- Prepare for their arrival
- Have a project for them to work on
- Have them present at the end of the program

### And a few more

- A good mentor is someone who has more experience than you
- Can communicate that experience.
- They're not answering the questions for you,
  but steering you in the right direction to answer them for yourself.
- Someone to both challenge you and support you through those challenges.

When being mentored, you need the opportunity to have discussions
about *why* this technology or that process is being chosen. 

Mentioned: [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) 

Giving mentees an understanding that there may be reasons outside the technology itself
for making technology choices could be good for self-esteem
as well as giving them the opportunity to have a more well-rounded perspective.

From a mentee's point of view, it's really nice to have a mentor
who is willing to be vulnerable.
Someone who is willing to say: "I don't know, let's work it out together."

Mentioned: "Confident humility" phrase by Angela Harms,
which she talks about on
this [Ruby Rogues podcast](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/049-rr-agile-communication-with-angela-harms/)

## 3: Tech Lead

Camille says that being a tech lead is a lot more responsibilities for probably not more pay.
However, if you wish to climb the management ladder, then it is a good role to experience.

Being a tech lead or a manager doesn't mean you have to be the best developer.
But most of the group feels a technical manager needs to stay technical (to some degree.)

Being a tech lead should be a role rather than a position.
You don't have to be a super experienced developer to be able to lead a team.
What you actually need are good communication skills, empathy, and organisational skills.
