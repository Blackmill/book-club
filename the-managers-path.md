# The Manager's Path

# JAN 22

## 1: Management 101

### What to expect from a manager

**Personal experience: what made them good managers:**

- Understanding the work to be done and the constraints on it
- Strong vision to put across to the team, and made clear what your role is on that team
- Not micro-managers and allow people to make their own mistakes, and gave support as needed
- Trusted and be apart of something bigger
- People's managers
- Shielded the team from demanding product owners and account managers

Camille talks more about day to day routines:

- 1:1 meetings - congratulate or deal with issues regularly
- Feedback and workplace guidance
- Training and career growth

Mentioned by Michael: [Office Vibe](https://www.officevibe.com)

### How to be managed

- What do you want
- Be responsible for yourself
- Choose your manager
- Interview the management
- If you plan to do your own thing, choose a workplace
  that has a track record of people that started on their own.

## Mini retro

- Technical: work through the examples
- Non-technical: usually just have a discussion around the topic
- Use GitHub for notes, and make a GH issue for the next meeting
  so that people can add notes/comments/questions to help with the agenda
- Be more prepared!
- Better way to RSVP ??

## 2: Mentoring

**Three types of mentoring:**

- Interns
- New hires
- Technical or career mentoring

### Camille's tips

- Don't disappear
- Listen carefully
- Communicate clearly
- Calibrate your responses
- Prepare for their arrival
- Have a project for them to work on
- Have them present at the end of the program

### And a few more

- A good mentor is someone who has more experience than you
- Can communicate that experience.
- They're not answering the questions for you,
  but steering you in the right direction to answer them for yourself.
- Someone to both challenge you and support you through those challenges.

When being mentored, you need the opportunity to have discussions
about *why* this technology or that process is being chosen. 

Mentioned: [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) 

Giving mentees an understanding that there may be reasons outside the technology itself
for making technology choices could be good for self-esteem
as well as giving them the opportunity to have a more well-rounded perspective.

Mentioned: [To gem, or not to gem](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/to-gem-or-not-to-gem).

From a mentee's point of view, it's really nice to have a mentor
who is willing to be vulnerable.
Someone who is willing to say: "I don't know, let's work it out together."

Mentioned: "Confident humility" phrase by Angela Harms,
which she talks about on
this [Ruby Rogues podcast](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/049-rr-agile-communication-with-angela-harms/)

## 3: Tech Lead

Camille says that being a tech lead is a lot more responsibilities for probably not more pay.
However, if you wish to climb the management ladder, then it is a good role to experience.

Being a tech lead or a manager doesn't mean you have to be the best developer.
But most of the group feels a technical manager needs to stay technical (to some degree.)

Being a tech lead should be a role rather than a position.
You don't have to be a super experienced developer to be able to lead a team.
What you actually need are good communication skills, empathy, and organisational skills.

## 4: Managing People

#### Starting a new reporting relationship

- Build trust and rapport
- [Questions for our first 1:1 by Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)
- Create 30/60/90-day plan
- Encourage participation by updating eh new hire documentation
- Communicate expectations
- Get feedback from a new hire, with a grain of salt

#### Have 1:1s

- Regular scheduled sessions
- Styles:
  - To-do list meeting
  - The catch-up
  - The feedback and coaching meeting
  - The progress report
  - Getting to know you
- Outside of office
- Keep notes
- Share those notes with your report

#### Micromanager vs delegator

- Autonomy
- Tips for efficient delegation:
  - Use the team's goals to understand which details you should dig into
  - Gather information from the systems before going to people
  - Adjust your focus depending on the stage of projects
  - Establish standards for code and systems: for example, style guide, and pull request reviews
  - Treat open sharing of information in a neutral to positive way

#### Creating a culture of continuous feedback

- Know and observe the people on the team
- Give yourself a task to regularly identify people who deserve a praise
- Provide lightweight, regular feedback
- It will help people accept corrective feedback when the time comes
- Go beyond "good job"

#### Performance reviews

> You owe your team enough time to read the collected feedback, digest it, and summarize it well

- Try to account for the full year, not just the last couple of months
- Use concrete examples and excerpts from peer reviews
- Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths
- When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused
- Don't report all grudges, be selective and critical.
- Avoid big surprises!!

#### Cultivating careers

- Identify growth potential
- Familiarise yourself with the promotion process

#### Firing

- Performance improvement plan

> Depending on the company, such a plan might actually be an effort to turn an employee around, but often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being fired.

- Notes from previous 1:1 and feedback sessions for HR

### Assessing your own experience

1. Have you set up regular 1-1s with your direct reports?
1. When was the last time you talked to your reports about their career development? If it was more than three months ago, can you make sure to put this in your next 1-1s?
1. Have you given feedback to your reports in the last week? When was the last time you handed out kudos in front of the team?
1. When was the last time someone behaved in a way that needed correction? How long did it take you to give corrective feedback? Did you give the feedback in private, or did you do it in public?
1. Have you ever been given a performance review that felt like a waste of time? What was it missing that could have made it more valuable?
1. What was the most useful piece of performance feedback you ever got? How was it delivered to you?
1. Do you know how the process of promoting people works in your company? If not, can you ask someone to walk you through it?

## 5: Managing a team

**Why do we think leadership is natural? how do we practice in the workplace?**

- Michael: Similarity with Family - although you get thrown in the deep end
- Michael: Organised experiences with organisations like scouts,
  dance clubs where management of a group to achieve a goal is modelled and taught

A manager should have a _large_ impact on an organisation rather than a senior developer.
A lot of senior devs seem not to be able to grasp that and wonder why they don't transition.

Managers role is to:

- Keep team focused
- Make sure tech deliveries are met

Managers need not be _most_ technical in the team,
there could be in different roles, for example people managers.

**About staying technical**

- Keep career options open
- Credibility
- Understand processes
- Foresee bottlenecks

> if you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team,
they must see you as technically credible. Without technical credibility you face an uphill battle,
and even though you may be able to get into a position of leadership in one company,
your options will be limited. Don’t underestimate the value
of your technical skills as you work to become a successful engineering manager.

> Why bother writing any code if all you’re doing is small stuff?
The answer is that you need to stay enough in the code
to see where the bottlenecks and process problems are.

> It’s hard to make up lost time when you stop writing code,
and if you do it too early in your career,
you may never achieve sufficient technical savvy to get beyond the role of middle management.

Job of a team lead is about "determining shortest path through system to implement new feature"

Discussion of a manager that writes some code vs no code (pure manager).
Are you on a maker's schedule or a manager's schedule?
Sometimes it is hard to balance in jobs that require both.

When promoted over a peer:
  
- be vulnerable, open, pick your battles, be mature
- be mature, interesting that that needs still to be mentioned,
maybe it is mentioned to evoke that thought of maturity :)

#### Debugging dysfunctional teams

- *Not shipping*
  - infrequent releases could be because of poor release tooling,
    heavily manual testing, features that are too big
    or developers who don't know how to break their work down
  - know when to push and when not to - sounds easy but how do you know when to do each
  - do things that hurt regularly to remove bottlenecks
  - resource contentions for being able to ship
  - Michael: reminds me of book [Tom DeMarco "Slack, Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency"](https://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698)
- *People drama*
  - brilliant jerks, not team players, negative person leads to a toxic environment
  - Michael: we find pairing, inter team one-on-one's
    and a regular rotation of contractors has helped that - 
    that said we are becoming less contractors and one team
    so no inter-team rotation - key to hire the right "cultural fit" -
    the person who will excel at our place of work
  - Michael: have seen a number of examples of people underachievin
    in one job only to change jobs and excel - just the right fit?
  - nip it in the bud quickly
- *Unhappiness due to overwork*
  - "system sustainability" over "technical debt" 20%
  - Michael: I have seen this work and not work, really have to get business onboard
  - Elle: cleaning the code base as you go, and doing improvements
    as part of feature work along the way. Cause stopping feature delivery
    for a certain amount of time to do refactoring, just never works.
  - Bug free Tuesday or Patch Thursday strategies
  - Michael: had this in first team I lead at RedBubble - we had the most boring job,
    recreating platform for DR in cloud in a test driven way but we were the fun team!
- *Collaboration problems between teams*
  - regular catchups, non work related activities
  - Michael: I would still prefer a coding dojo/coding competition over go carts

#### The shield

- Don't treat the team like children
- Provide context
- Alleviate gossip

> only once was I not shielded, when I worked directly under the CEO

> ability to switch context from reporting to higher level stakeholders,
  to dealing with underperformance, to celebrating a team win all before lunch

#### How to drive good decisions

1. Create a data-driven culture
  - Michael: have seen 2 extremes of this, it will be done when it is done
    and if you don't get the increase in A/B test then throw it all out and try again
2. Develop customer empathy to help provide context around work
3. Look into the future
4. Review the outcomes of your decisions and projects
5. Run retrospectives

#### Conflict avoider vs conflict taming

**Do's and don'ts of managing conflict:**

1. Don't rely exclusively on consensus
2. Do set up precesses to depersonalise decisions,
   for example shared understanding of the goals, risks and questions to be answered
3. Don't turn a blind eye to simmering issues
4. Do address issues without too much drama
5. Don't take it out on other teams
6. Do remember to be kind, not "nice"
7. Don't be afraid of conflict
8. Do get curious

#### Team cohesion destroyers

> When companies talk about hiring for “culture fit,”
  they often mean they want to hire people they can be friendly with.
  While this can have some unwanted consequences, such as discrimination,
  it comes from a wise place. Teams that are friendly are happier, gel faster,
  and tend to produce better results.

- Brilliant jerk
- Non-communicator
- Lacking respect

#### Advanced project management rules of thumb

- None of this is a replacement for agile project management
- You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter
- Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board
- As you approach deadline, it is your job to say no to new features, and by that to cut scope
- Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks
- Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate

#### Assessing Your Own Experience

- What are your new responsibilities now that you’re the manager of a team?
  What tasks have you stopped doing or handed off to someone else
  in order to make time for these new responsibilities?
- How well do you feel you know the day-to-day challenges of writing,
  deploying, and supporting code on your team?
- How often does your team mark work as completed?
- When was the last time you wrote a feature, debugged a problem,
  or paired with a member of your team on some code he or she was struggling with?
- Are there one or two team members who cause the bulk of negativity on the team?
  What is your plan for getting rid of the problem moving forward?
- Do your team members seem engaged with one another? Do they smile in meetings?
  Make jokes in chat? Get coffee or lunch together?
  When was the last time you all sat down together without talking about work?
- How does your team make decisions? Do you have a process
  for assigning decision-making responsibility?
  What decisions do you hold yourself responsible for making?
- When was the last time you reviewed a completed project to see if it had achieved its goals?
- How well does your team understand why they are working on the projects they are working on?
- When was the last time you cut scope on a project? What did you use to determine which pieces to cut?

## 6: Managing multiple teams

### Managing time

- Manager schedule
- Transition period where you miss code
- Learn to differentiate between "urgent" and "important" when prioritising tasks
- Set times in the day to look at email -- rather than respond whenever an email comes in
- Example of important but not urgent task is preparing for meetings -- to ensure meetings are healthy, short, and productive.

Common tasks:

- Setting goals for the teams
- Help product team add details to product road map
- Following up on task completion


### When to delegate?

Like a juggler, or plates spinner...
> Your plates are the people and projects you're overseeing, and your job is to figure out how much attention each one needs at what time.

> Delegation is the primary way you claw yourself out of the feeling of having too many plates spinning at once.

- Delegate simple and frequent tasks
- Do simple and infrequent tasks
- Use complex and infrequent tasks as training opportunities for rising leads
- Delegate complex and infrequent tasks develop the team
- **Pretty much delegate as much as you can**

This brought a lot of conversation about raising people up beneath you. Giving them the work and teaching them how to do it so you can remove yourself from the day-to-day. 

If you do everything yourself, why would you be promoted? You're too needed where you are. Whereas if you share your knowledge, you become dispensable and thus, moveable.

We also discussed RACI a bit: http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_raci.html

### Warning signs

- Changed behaviour
- Team lead claims progress is good but avoids update chats
- Team has no energy
- Project list changes every week
- Small team but seems fragmanted

### Strategies for saying no

- "Yes and..." for example: 

> Yes we can do this, and all we will need to do is delay the start of this other project that is currently on the road map

- Create policies
- "Help me say yes" - learn more facts
- Appeal to budget
- Act together as a team to say no

> When you know that you need to say no, it's better to say it quickly than to delay and drag out the process

We talked about difficult "No" conversations. Particularly with directions in a hierarchy. Saying no upwards is harder, especially with a strongly hierarchical culture. Saying no downwards can feel much simpler as you expect reports to abide by it, but if you don't do it early enough that can quite difficult.

Establishing relationships and sharing the decision amongst the group makes a no easier as it becomes a consensus and everybody has a had a chance to be heard.

### Technical elements beyond code

> Assuming that the job at this level becomes essentially non-technical is a mistake

Book: [First, Break All the Rules](https://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently-ebook/dp/B01E7M6INO) discusses several questions:

- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
- Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?

### Measuring the health of your teams

Key indicators for a team that knows what to do and has the tools and time to do it:

- Frequency of code releases
- Frequency of code check-ins
- Infrequency of incidents

> I bet if you honestly take a look at a team that isn't releasing frequently, you'll see cracks.

**Your job is to enable your teams to be productive, challenge them to do better work, and help them find the time to make their work more interesting.**

> You have to be the advocate and push for technical process improvements that can lead to increased engineer productivity, even if you're not implementing them all yourself.

<br>
> Determining the level of software quality you need for the product you're building and adjusting that measure every time us a technical challenge for you, the manager, to help address.

- Incident management and escalation process for issue analysis, to learn from the problem, and working out how to reduce or prevent them in the future
- Otherwise engineers on-call get burnt out
- Overemphasising incident prevention may cause for development work to slow that you build defect free code -- which is almost as bad as moving too fast and shipping buggy unstable code.

### Us vs. them, or how to be a team player

Inside clique:

- Will likely dissolve when their leader leaves the company
- Is resistant to outside ideas
- Empire building
- Inflexible

We talked about this with individuals who don't click easily with the existing team. Another personal example was a mirror of the one in the book.

This evolved into a conversation about culture. Do you hire people so that they fit easier? Do you improve your onboarding to help people mesh better? We talked about ensuring your hires share the same values as the organisation. 

> As a manager, be careful about focusing on your teams to the exclusion of the wider group.

Durable teams:

- Resilient to loss of individuals
- Driven to find better ways to achieve their purpose
- First-team focused
- Open to changes that serve their purpose

How do you know your team is healthy and strong? Resilience and communication are vital, but what are good indicators? 

Talking about how sharing staff between teams, via regular rotations, promotes a lot of benefits. Examples:

- Junior engineers doing rotating through different teams every few months when they first join and then choosing one 6-8 months in.
- A developer and support engineer swapping each week. The developer can learn the pain of support, provide deep product knowledge, and bring bug-fixing passion back to the dev team. The support engineer pairs on fixing bugs and improving features.
- A company that starts every employee in Support for the first week


### The virtues of laziness and impatience

> "Laziness, impatience, and hubris" are virtues of engineers
> -- Larry Wall, [Programming Perl](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Perl-Unmatched-processing-scripting-ebook-dp-B007S291SA/dp/B007S291SA)

```
According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

- Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.
- Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
- Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.

Ref: http://threevirtues.com
```

> These virtues persist into leadership, and learning how to channel these traits into advantage is something I encourage all managers to do

**Basically, work smarter, not harder**

### Assessing your own experience

- When was the last time you reviewed your schedule for things that you’re doing but that aren’t providing a lot of value for you or your team? Look back on the past couple of weeks. Look forward to the next couple of weeks. What did you accomplish, and what do you hope to accomplish?
- If you are still writing code, how does this fit in with the rest of your schedule? Are you doing it after hours? What’s driving you to continue to spend this time?
- What was the last task you delegated to a member of one of your teams? Was it simple or complex? How is the person you delegated to handling the new task?
- Who are the rising leaders of your teams? What is your plan for coaching them to take on bigger leadership roles? What tasks are you giving them to prepare them for more responsibility?
- Does the process of writing, releasing, and supporting code seem to function smoothly on your teams? When was the last time there was a noticeable incident with part of this process? What happened, and how did the team respond to it? How often does the process encounter these exceptional conditions?
- When was the last time you pushed your team to cut the scope of a project? When you cut scope do you cut features, technical quality, or both? How do you decide?
- When was the last time you sent email after 8 pm or on the weekend? Did the person you sent that email to respond? Did you need him or her to respond?
