# The Manager's Path

# JAN 22

## 1: Management 101

### What to expect from a manager

**Personal experience: what made them good managers:**

- Understanding the work to be done and the constraints on it
- Strong vision to put across to the team, and made clear what your role is on that team
- Not micro-managers and allow people to make their own mistakes, and gave support as needed
- Trusted and be apart of something bigger
- People's managers
- Shielded the team from demanding product owners and account managers

Camille talks more about day to day routines:

- 1:1 meetings - congratulate or deal with issues regularly
- Feedback and workplace guidance
- Training and career growth

Mentioned by Michael: [Office Vibe](https://www.officevibe.com)

### How to be managed

- What do you want
- Be responsible for yourself
- Choose your manager
- Interview the management
- If you plan to do your own thing, choose a workplace
  that has a track record of people that started on their own.

## Mini retro

- Technical: work through the examples
- Non-technical: usually just have a discussion around the topic
- Use GitHub for notes, and make a GH issue for the next meeting
  so that people can add notes/comments/questions to help with the agenda
- Be more prepared!
- Better way to RSVP ??

## 2: Mentoring

**Three types of mentoring:**

- Interns
- New hires
- Technical or career mentoring

### Camille's tips

- Don't disappear
- Listen carefully
- Communicate clearly
- Calibrate your responses
- Prepare for their arrival
- Have a project for them to work on
- Have them present at the end of the program

### And a few more

- A good mentor is someone who has more experience than you
- Can communicate that experience.
- They're not answering the questions for you,
  but steering you in the right direction to answer them for yourself.
- Someone to both challenge you and support you through those challenges.

When being mentored, you need the opportunity to have discussions
about *why* this technology or that process is being chosen. 

Mentioned: [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) 

Giving mentees an understanding that there may be reasons outside the technology itself
for making technology choices could be good for self-esteem
as well as giving them the opportunity to have a more well-rounded perspective.

Mentioned: [To gem, or not to gem](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/to-gem-or-not-to-gem).

From a mentee's point of view, it's really nice to have a mentor
who is willing to be vulnerable.
Someone who is willing to say: "I don't know, let's work it out together."

Mentioned: "Confident humility" phrase by Angela Harms,
which she talks about on
this [Ruby Rogues podcast](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/049-rr-agile-communication-with-angela-harms/)

## 3: Tech Lead

Camille says that being a tech lead is a lot more responsibilities for probably not more pay.
However, if you wish to climb the management ladder, then it is a good role to experience.

Being a tech lead or a manager doesn't mean you have to be the best developer.
But most of the group feels a technical manager needs to stay technical (to some degree.)

Being a tech lead should be a role rather than a position.
You don't have to be a super experienced developer to be able to lead a team.
What you actually need are good communication skills, empathy, and organisational skills.

## 4: Managing People

#### Starting a new reporting relationship

- Build trust and rapport
- [Questions for our first 1:1 by Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)
- Create 30/60/90-day plan
- Encourage participation by updating eh new hire documentation
- Communicate expectations
- Get feedback from a new hire, with a grain of salt

#### Have 1:1s

- Regular scheduled sessions
- Styles:
  - To-do list meeting
  - The catch-up
  - The feedback and coaching meeting
  - The progress report
  - Getting to know you
- Outside of office
- Keep notes
- Share those notes with your report

#### Micromanager vs delegator

- Autonomy
- Tips for efficient delegation:
  - Use the team's goals to understand which details you should dig into
  - Gather information from the systems before going to people
  - Adjust your focus depending on the stage of projects
  - Establish standards for code and systems: for example, style guide, and pull request reviews
  - Treat open sharing of information in a neutral to positive way

#### Creating a culture of continuous feedback

- Know and observe the people on the team
- Give yourself a task to regularly identify people who deserve a praise
- Provide lightweight, regular feedback
- It will help people accept corrective feedback when the time comes
- Go beyond "good job"

#### Performance reviews

> You owe your team enough time to read the collected feedback, digest it, and summarize it well

- Try to account for the full year, not just the last couple of months
- Use concrete examples and excerpts from peer reviews
- Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths
- When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused
- Don't report all grudges, be selective and critical.
- Avoid big surprises!!

#### Cultivating careers

- Identify growth potential
- Familiarise yourself with the promotion process

#### Firing

- Performance improvement plan

> Depending on the company, such a plan might actually be an effort to turn an employee around, but often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being fired.

- Notes from previous 1:1 and feedback sessions for HR

### Assessing your own experience

1. Have you set up regular 1-1s with your direct reports?
1. When was the last time you talked to your reports about their career development? If it was more than three months ago, can you make sure to put this in your next 1-1s?
1. Have you given feedback to your reports in the last week? When was the last time you handed out kudos in front of the team?
1. When was the last time someone behaved in a way that needed correction? How long did it take you to give corrective feedback? Did you give the feedback in private, or did you do it in public?
1. Have you ever been given a performance review that felt like a waste of time? What was it missing that could have made it more valuable?
1. What was the most useful piece of performance feedback you ever got? How was it delivered to you?
1. Do you know how the process of promoting people works in your company? If not, can you ask someone to walk you through it?

## 5: Managing a team

**Why do we think leadership is natural? how do we practice in the workplace?**

- Michael: Similarity with Family - although you get thrown in the deep end
- Michael: Organised experiences with organisations like scouts,
  dance clubs where management of a group to achieve a goal is modelled and taught

A manager should have a _large_ impact on an organisation rather than a senior developer.
A lot of senior devs seem not to be able to grasp that and wonder why they don't transition.

Managers role is to:

- Keep team focused
- Make sure tech deliveries are met

Managers need not be _most_ technical in the team,
there could be in different roles, for example people managers.

**About staying technical**

- Keep career options open
- Credibility
- Understand processes
- Foresee bottlenecks

> if you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team,
they must see you as technically credible. Without technical credibility you face an uphill battle,
and even though you may be able to get into a position of leadership in one company,
your options will be limited. Don’t underestimate the value
of your technical skills as you work to become a successful engineering manager.

> Why bother writing any code if all you’re doing is small stuff?
The answer is that you need to stay enough in the code
to see where the bottlenecks and process problems are.

> It’s hard to make up lost time when you stop writing code,
and if you do it too early in your career,
you may never achieve sufficient technical savvy to get beyond the role of middle management.

Job of a team lead is about "determining shortest path through system to implement new feature"

Discussion of a manager that writes some code vs no code (pure manager).
Are you on a maker's schedule or a manager's schedule?
Sometimes it is hard to balance in jobs that require both.

When promoted over a peer:
  
- be vulnerable, open, pick your battles, be mature
- be mature, interesting that that needs still to be mentioned,
maybe it is mentioned to evoke that thought of maturity :)

#### Debugging dysfunctional teams

- *Not shipping*
  - infrequent releases could be because of poor release tooling,
    heavily manual testing, features that are too big
    or developers who don't know how to break their work down
  - know when to push and when not to - sounds easy but how do you know when to do each
  - do things that hurt regularly to remove bottlenecks
  - resource contentions for being able to ship
  - Michael: reminds me of book [Tom DeMarco "Slack, Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency"](https://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698)
- *People drama*
  - brilliant jerks, not team players, negative person leads to a toxic environment
  - Michael: we find pairing, inter team one-on-one's
    and a regular rotation of contractors has helped that - 
    that said we are becoming less contractors and one team
    so no inter-team rotation - key to hire the right "cultural fit" -
    the person who will excel at our place of work
  - Michael: have seen a number of examples of people underachievin
    in one job only to change jobs and excel - just the right fit?
  - nip it in the bud quickly
- *Unhappiness due to overwork*
  - "system sustainability" over "technical debt" 20%
  - Michael: I have seen this work and not work, really have to get business onboard
  - Elle: cleaning the code base as you go, and doing improvements
    as part of feature work along the way. Cause stopping feature delivery
    for a certain amount of time to do refactoring, just never works.
  - Bug free Tuesday or Patch Thursday strategies
  - Michael: had this in first team I lead at RedBubble - we had the most boring job,
    recreating platform for DR in cloud in a test driven way but we were the fun team!
- *Collaboration problems between teams*
  - regular catchups, non work related activities
  - Michael: I would still prefer a coding dojo/coding competition over go carts

#### The shield

- Don't treat the team like children
- Provide context
- Alleviate gossip

> only once was I not shielded, when I worked directly under the CEO

> ability to switch context from reporting to higher level stakeholders,
  to dealing with underperformance, to celebrating a team win all before lunch

#### How to drive good decisions

1. Create a data-driven culture
  - Michael: have seen 2 extremes of this, it will be done when it is done
    and if you don't get the increase in A/B test then throw it all out and try again
2. Develop customer empathy to help provide context around work
3. Look into the future
4. Review the outcomes of your decisions and projects
5. Run retrospectives

#### Conflict avoider vs conflict taming

**Do's and don'ts of managing conflict:**

1. Don't rely exclusively on consensus
2. Do set up precesses to depersonalise decisions,
   for example shared understanding of the goals, risks and questions to be answered
3. Don't turn a blind eye to simmering issues
4. Do address issues without too much drama
5. Don't take it out on other teams
6. Do remember to be kind, not "nice"
7. Don't be afraid of conflict
8. Do get curious

#### Team cohesion destroyers

> When companies talk about hiring for “culture fit,”
  they often mean they want to hire people they can be friendly with.
  While this can have some unwanted consequences, such as discrimination,
  it comes from a wise place. Teams that are friendly are happier, gel faster,
  and tend to produce better results.

- Brilliant jerk
- Non-communicator
- Lacking respect

#### Advanced project management rules of thumb

- None of this is a replacement for agile project management
- You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter
- Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board
- As you approach deadline, it is your job to say no to new features, and by that to cut scope
- Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks
- Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate

#### Assessing Your Own Experience

- What are your new responsibilities now that you’re the manager of a team?
  What tasks have you stopped doing or handed off to someone else
  in order to make time for these new responsibilities?
- How well do you feel you know the day-to-day challenges of writing,
  deploying, and supporting code on your team?
- How often does your team mark work as completed?
- When was the last time you wrote a feature, debugged a problem,
  or paired with a member of your team on some code he or she was struggling with?
- Are there one or two team members who cause the bulk of negativity on the team?
  What is your plan for getting rid of the problem moving forward?
- Do your team members seem engaged with one another? Do they smile in meetings?
  Make jokes in chat? Get coffee or lunch together?
  When was the last time you all sat down together without talking about work?
- How does your team make decisions? Do you have a process
  for assigning decision-making responsibility?
  What decisions do you hold yourself responsible for making?
- When was the last time you reviewed a completed project to see if it had achieved its goals?
- How well does your team understand why they are working on the projects they are working on?
- When was the last time you cut scope on a project? What did you use to determine which pieces to cut?

## 6: Managing multiple teams

### Managing time

- Manager schedule
- Transition period where you miss code
- Learn to differentiate between "urgent" and "important" when prioritising tasks
- Set times in the day to look at email -- rather than respond whenever an email comes in
- Example of important but not urgent task is preparing for meetings -- to ensure meetings are healthy, short, and productive.

Common tasks:

- Setting goals for the teams
- Help product team add details to product road map
- Following up on task completion


### When to delegate?

Like a juggler, or plates spinner...
> Your plates are the people and projects you're overseeing, and your job is to figure out how much attention each one needs at what time.

> Delegation is the primary way you claw yourself out of the feeling of having too many plates spinning at once.

- Delegate simple and frequent tasks
- Do simple and infrequent tasks
- Use complex and infrequent tasks as training opportunities for rising leads
- Delegate complex and infrequent tasks develop the team
- **Pretty much delegate as much as you can**

This brought a lot of conversation about raising people up beneath you. Giving them the work and teaching them how to do it so you can remove yourself from the day-to-day. 

If you do everything yourself, why would you be promoted? You're too needed where you are. Whereas if you share your knowledge, you become dispensable and thus, moveable.

We also discussed RACI a bit: http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_raci.html

### Warning signs

- Changed behaviour
- Team lead claims progress is good but avoids update chats
- Team has no energy
- Project list changes every week
- Small team but seems fragmanted

### Strategies for saying no

- "Yes and..." for example: 

> Yes we can do this, and all we will need to do is delay the start of this other project that is currently on the road map

- Create policies
- "Help me say yes" - learn more facts
- Appeal to budget
- Act together as a team to say no

> When you know that you need to say no, it's better to say it quickly than to delay and drag out the process

We talked about difficult "No" conversations. Particularly with directions in a hierarchy. Saying no upwards is harder, especially with a strongly hierarchical culture. Saying no downwards can feel much simpler as you expect reports to abide by it, but if you don't do it early enough that can quite difficult.

Establishing relationships and sharing the decision amongst the group makes a no easier as it becomes a consensus and everybody has a had a chance to be heard.

### Technical elements beyond code

> Assuming that the job at this level becomes essentially non-technical is a mistake

Book: [First, Break All the Rules](https://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently-ebook/dp/B01E7M6INO) discusses several questions:

- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
- Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?

### Measuring the health of your teams

Key indicators for a team that knows what to do and has the tools and time to do it:

- Frequency of code releases
- Frequency of code check-ins
- Infrequency of incidents

> I bet if you honestly take a look at a team that isn't releasing frequently, you'll see cracks.

**Your job is to enable your teams to be productive, challenge them to do better work, and help them find the time to make their work more interesting.**

> You have to be the advocate and push for technical process improvements that can lead to increased engineer productivity, even if you're not implementing them all yourself.

<br>
> Determining the level of software quality you need for the product you're building and adjusting that measure every time us a technical challenge for you, the manager, to help address.

- Incident management and escalation process for issue analysis, to learn from the problem, and working out how to reduce or prevent them in the future
- Otherwise engineers on-call get burnt out
- Overemphasising incident prevention may cause for development work to slow that you build defect free code -- which is almost as bad as moving too fast and shipping buggy unstable code.

### Us vs. them, or how to be a team player

Inside clique:

- Will likely dissolve when their leader leaves the company
- Is resistant to outside ideas
- Empire building
- Inflexible

We talked about this with individuals who don't click easily with the existing team. Another personal example was a mirror of the one in the book.

This evolved into a conversation about culture. Do you hire people so that they fit easier? Do you improve your onboarding to help people mesh better? We talked about ensuring your hires share the same values as the organisation. 

> As a manager, be careful about focusing on your teams to the exclusion of the wider group.

Durable teams:

- Resilient to loss of individuals
- Driven to find better ways to achieve their purpose
- First-team focused
- Open to changes that serve their purpose

How do you know your team is healthy and strong? Resilience and communication are vital, but what are good indicators? 

Talking about how sharing staff between teams, via regular rotations, promotes a lot of benefits. Examples:

- Junior engineers doing rotating through different teams every few months when they first join and then choosing one 6-8 months in.
- A developer and support engineer swapping each week. The developer can learn the pain of support, provide deep product knowledge, and bring bug-fixing passion back to the dev team. The support engineer pairs on fixing bugs and improving features.
- A company that starts every employee in Support for the first week


### The virtues of laziness and impatience

> "Laziness, impatience, and hubris" are virtues of engineers
> -- Larry Wall, [Programming Perl](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Perl-Unmatched-processing-scripting-ebook-dp-B007S291SA/dp/B007S291SA)

```
According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris

- Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.
- Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
- Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.

Ref: http://threevirtues.com
```

> These virtues persist into leadership, and learning how to channel these traits into advantage is something I encourage all managers to do

**Basically, work smarter, not harder**

### Assessing your own experience

- When was the last time you reviewed your schedule for things that you’re doing but that aren’t providing a lot of value for you or your team? Look back on the past couple of weeks. Look forward to the next couple of weeks. What did you accomplish, and what do you hope to accomplish?
- If you are still writing code, how does this fit in with the rest of your schedule? Are you doing it after hours? What’s driving you to continue to spend this time?
- What was the last task you delegated to a member of one of your teams? Was it simple or complex? How is the person you delegated to handling the new task?
- Who are the rising leaders of your teams? What is your plan for coaching them to take on bigger leadership roles? What tasks are you giving them to prepare them for more responsibility?
- Does the process of writing, releasing, and supporting code seem to function smoothly on your teams? When was the last time there was a noticeable incident with part of this process? What happened, and how did the team respond to it? How often does the process encounter these exceptional conditions?
- When was the last time you pushed your team to cut the scope of a project? When you cut scope do you cut features, technical quality, or both? How do you decide?
- When was the last time you sent email after 8 pm or on the weekend? Did the person you sent that email to respond? Did you need him or her to respond?

## 7: Managing managers

The job expectations for managing managers similar to managing multiple teams
but you will now be responsible for far more people
who may even be spread across disciplines for which you are not experienced.

Everyone agreed that this chapter felt very similar to Chapter 6: Managing Multiple Teams.

- Managing managers means you are directly managing
  about the same number of people as if you were managing multiple teams.
- When compared to managing multiple teams, that it is a similar hierarchy
  for managing Tech Leads as it is to managing managers.

### Adjusting to the role

Due to the added level of abstraction between you and the engineers,
it is more difficult to work out what needs your attention and where best to spend your time,
particularly if a team is working outside of your skill set.

Initially you'll want to follow up on all the little things until you figure out
what you don’t need to follow up on.
This will inevitably be a lot of work until you can adjust your focus.

### The fallacy of the open-door policy

It's common to hear a manager say they have an "open-door policy"
but then find that people are not lining up to tell them about their concerns.
It is the managers job to proactively ferret out problems.

Everyone agreed that none of us had ever seen an open door policy work.
Adam added that with open plan offices it was even more ridiculous because it simple became a metaphor.

From open door policy we got onto accountability and discussing the section of the chapter
which discusses how you are responsible for the performance of managers which you manage.
We discussed how you are the manager need to support those managers below you.

### Skip-level meetings

These are meetings with the people who report to the people who report to you
and they provide perspective on the health and focus of your teams.

In smaller organisations, 1-1 meetings provide focused feedback
but they are unrealistic with scale. A team lunch might be more appropriate
at a large organisation.
This approach can also make people more comfortable
to see you 1-1 when there are sensitive topics to be addressed.

The skip-level process also allows you to see when you are being "managed up" and keep grounded.

Discussion on this topic revolved around the fact
that Australian companies don't seem to use this process and we are not sure why.
Lachlan spoke about having seen it to at Github.

Discussing the process, Lachlan analogised it as being an elaborate process
to check that the managers you managed are actually doing their job
and are not just extremely good at managing you.

Adam discussed how in small business common that roles cover a lot of aspects
and that it is not feasible in many cases. That people often span aspects of multiple roles.

Elle added that it is easier in big business for people to have the space to specialise
which aligns closer to the things being covered in this chapter.

### Manager accountability

Mangers should be making your life easier but they may do this
by hiding problems from you—they need to be held accountable.

Even when it seems like there are mitigating circumstances,
it is always the managers responsibility
to keep the team moving forward although they may need your support or guidance.

People pleasers try to ensure everyone is happy and have an inability to say "no".
While they think they are helping moral and creating an environment
where people feel comfortable to fail, the opposite is true.

### Managing new managers

As with any new role, people new to management are going to find
there are a lot of things they don't know or understand.
It is in your best interests to spend more with a new manager,
ensure they know what they should be doing, and that they are doing it.

Use more frequent skip-level meetings to monitor their performance
and use the feedback to guide their development.

Look for signs of over-work as an indicator
that maybe the manager hasn't mastered delegation or is being overly controlling.

### Managing experienced managers

An experienced manger is likely to have the skills but,
if they were hired in from outside the business,
it's possible their management style doesn't match the culture of the organisation.
It’s easier to gain access to industry information
than it is to retrain someone who doesn't know how to work in your culture.

While you can learn from experienced managers and collaborate on areas of difference,
you are responsible for cultivating the culture of your organisation.

### Hiring managers

Hiring from outside an organisation can be tough—how do you interview for management skills?

Make sure they have the skills you need and that they're a culture match for your organisation.

 as a new manager you will be unproductive until you have learned how the company works.
That this could take several weeks.

[Years of experience is only a 3% indicator of future performance](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hire-like-google/)

That the research had found a 14% correlation between unstructured interviews and predicting future performance.
That IQ test had a 26% predictive indicator,
but that IQ tests were discriminatory, and that structured interviews had a 23% predictive percent.

The most important thing to do is to define the role.
Once you define the role (requirements) you look for someone who meets those requirements and then hire them.
Defining what you are looking for is key, and added that when interviewing,
it is important to standardise the process so that you can compare candidates accurately.

Adam added that as interviewers, we tend to use these questions to filter out poor candidates.

Elle discussed how when she hires for developers that she will get the candidate into the office to pair with someone for a day.
That having someone work for a day with the rest of the team allows for a better perspective.
She described how sometimes people who interview well can be disruptive when in a work situation;
That sometimes people behave differently when on lunch with other peers;
and that having them in the office was an effective way of finding out how they work.

Lachlan talked about a book by [Laszlo Bock - Work Rules!](https://www.workrules.net),
and that he had found it an interesting read to hear about hiring practices at google.

**The interview**

To evaluate skills:

1. Roleplay:
  - 1-1s
  - dealing with an underperforming employee
  - delivering negative a performance review
  - an employee who's thinking about quitting
1. Ask about:
  - a project that was running behind schedule and what they did
  - how they've coached employees who are struggling
  - management philosophy
1. Present to a room (but don't overvalue this)
1. Technical skills
  - abbreviated code test or Q&A
  - mediate a technical debate

When evaluating cultural fit:

- review Chapter 9
- do you need someone who dictates or collaborates

Do thorough reference checks and ask them:

- to describe the ways that the person succeeds as well as the ways they fail
- would they work with or for this person again
- what they love about the person, and what drives them crazy

When hiring outside your skill set:

- be cautious
- ask the person to teach you about the work they do
- ask lots of open questions

Discussed that there is quite a bit of repetition when reading it front to back.
Whereas some advice is good but lacking details on how to approach it.

### Debugging dysfunctional organisations

- Have a hypothesis
- Check the data - gather data to form a picture but not enough data on what context, when to check, or how often...

> Are production incidents happening that are taking up lots of time?
> Are a bunch of people sick? Are they bickering over coding style in their code review comments?
> Are the tickets that are being written vague, too big, too small?
> Does the team seem upbeat in their communication style, sharing fun things
> as well as important work in chat, or are they purely business?
> Look at their calendars. Is the team spending many hours a week in meetings?
> Is their manager not doing 1-1s?

- Observe the team
- Ask questions
- Check the team dynamics - friendly? banter? work collaboratively?
- Jump in to help - as the manager's manager, how can you be helpful?
- Be curious

### Setting expectations and delivering on schedule

Hopefully someone asks you because you're late,
because in an ideal situation people are informed and you are on time.

Engineers often don’t want to estimate
but even inaccurate estimates can help escalate complexity to the rest of the team.

It's possible to do up-front work to reduce the unknowns
and ultimately produce a more accurate estimate.
Learn from past estimates both to help increase accuracy
but also to understand how to better manage communication and expectation.

> Therefore, you must always be aggressive about sharing estimates
> and updates to estimates, even when people don’t ask,
> especially if you believe that the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks.
> This means you must be aggressive about getting estimates,

> Engineers often don’t want to estimate at all,
> or estimate beyond the boundary of an agile sprint (generally two weeks).
> This philosophy is completely reasonable if you believe that estimates must be fairly accurate,
> that the requirements are unknown or will change frequently,
> and that most of the work should be bound
> to features that mostly fit within one or two sprint efforts.

> So, accept the fact that you’ll need to do some degree of estimation.
> Play with different methods, and see what works for your company,
> but make it a habit across your teams.

Keeping track of estimation vs actual time is useful for future estimations.

Adam keeps track of estimation vs reality, and also per person,
to get an idea for example of who is an optimistic estimator.

Making estimates should incorporate:

- 20% staff off time
- 20% maintenance
- 50-100% padding for unknowns

100% padding can sometimes be too low for high risk items. And when there are many unknowns,
adding 200 or 300 percent more time on the estimation is sometimes necessary.

> Showing some empathy for the person providing pressure and being willing
to help out in other ways can go a long way to shifting focus from blame to action.

When you are being unnecessarily pushed,
it is usually because someone is stressed or being pushed themselves.
Show empathy for the person providing pressure and being willing to help out in other ways.

Start a conversation with them is a good advice, which leads to conversation about reducing scope.

Don't be afraid to work with stakeholders to cut scope.

### Strategies for handling roadmap uncertainty

Changes in strategy are where being stuck in “middle management” feels the most unpleasant.

- Be realistic about the likelihood of changing plans given the size and stage of the company you work for.
- Think about how to break down big projects into a series of smaller deliverables
  so that you can achieve some of the results, even if you don’t necessarily complete the grand vision.
- Don’t overpromise a future of technical projects.              
- Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.”
- Understand how important various engineering projects really are.
                
### About staying technically relevant

- Oversee technical investment
- Ask informed questions
- Analyse and explain engineering and business tradeoffs
- Make specific requests
- Use your experience as a gut check

Possibly wouldn't have the time at this level to code.
Keep active in writing code without bogging down the team.

**How to:**

- Read the code - review pull requests
- Pick an unknown area, and ask an engineer - what engineer will think that this is efficient.
  Maybe instead read the code and come to the engineer with questions
- Attend postmortems - gives an idea of what's going wrong, finger on the pulse
- Keep up with industry trends and software processes - are you supposed to go and learn typescript now?
- Foster a network of technical people outside of the company
- **Never stop learning**
                
**Assessing your own experience**

1. How often do you talk to your skip-level reports?
  Do you meet with them one on one, or as groups?
  How do you proactively reach out to your teams?
  How much time do you spend seeking out information,
  instead of passively handling the information that comes to you?
  When was the last time you sat in on a team meeting?
- Without looking at your existing documentation,
  write down your view of the job description for the engineering managers who report to you.
  What are they responsible for? How do you evaluate them?
  What areas are most important for success, in your opinion?
- Now, look at the job description your company uses.
  Are there differences in what you wrote compared to that description,
  or do they match well?
  Given that description, what things are you potentially overlooking in evaluating them?
- Finally, do a quick mental review of their current performance.
  What areas need coaching and development? Make time to cover this in your next 1-1.
- If you manage an area that is outside of your technical comfort zone,
  how often do you check in on that area to make sure things are going well?
  Have you taken some time to learn from the manager of that area
  a little bit about what it takes to succeed in that role?
  What new things have you learned in the past three months
  that help you understand that team better?
- If you have one team that is clearly operating more smoothly than others,
  what are the differences you notice in their processes? Their interactions?
  Is their manager doing things differently than other managers?
  How does the team interact with that manager,
  and how does that manager interact with you?
- What is your interview process for managers?
  Do you spend time talking about their personal values and their management philosophy?
  Do you have the team interview their potential manager,
  or do you keep them out of the process?
  Do you spend time getting references for candidates?
- What are your organization’s goals this quarter? This year?
  How are you merging product goals (if any) with the technical goals?
  Does your organization have a mandate that is well understood by the teams?

  ## Chapter 9: bootstrapping culture

As the team grows and evolves, it’s important to attend to your culture as you would attend to any other important piece of infrastructure that you rely on.

classic, unstructured “scrappy startup” model

For many people who are attracted to startup culture, the ideas of “structure” and “process” are seen as pointless at best and harmful at worst.

Everyone called out the insight that process and structure should be in aid of improving communication.



Consider not only what you care about, but also how you can scale that knowledge and effort effectively as the company and team grows and evolves.

Early startups attract people who are capable of dealing with extremely high amounts of uncertainty and risk in exchange for equally high degrees of freedom to operate.

Having no titles is in one sense a decision, but in another sense it’s a decision that means you never need to decide what someone’s title will be, you won’t need to worry about promoting people to new titles, and you don’t need to build up the apparatus that will make future decisions about titles because you have removed that as an option.

Deciding not to decide right now is a popular option for new companies, because it really doesn’t matter at the scale of a few people.

[The Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) by Jo Freeman

Pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication. Interestingly, Freeman describes a set of circumstances in which the unstructured group can, in fact, work:

- It is task oriented
- It is relatively small and homogeneous.
- There is a high degree of communciation
- There is a low degree of skill specialisation

Hiring “full stack” engineers who are exclusively sourced from the professional and social networks of the current team results in low skill specialisation and high homogeneity. Forcing the team to be collocated lowers communication barriers. And perhaps most critically, having an engineering team that operates solely…

Structure can come too early, and cause harm by slowing down a group that should be focused on other things.

more people’s lives depend on you, so you need to consider your movements more carefully, but you still feel in control and can turn the plane relatively quickly.

### Assessing your role

- **People**: the more people you have, the more thoughtful structure you need to get everyone moving in the right direction.
  Modern companies often put their structural focus on goal setting instead of trying to make all decisions from the top,
- **Age**: the longer a company is around, the more habits become entrenched. On the other hand, the longer a company has been around, the more likely it is to continue to survive.
- **Size of existing infrastructure**: the more existing business rules and infrastructure you have, the more you’ll need clarity on how to handle them.
- **Risk tolerance**: are you in a highly regulated industry? Do you have a lot to lose if certain types of mistakes are made? Or are you in an unregulated industry, with little on the line? Your structures and processes should reflect this. In general, the more people you have depending on you and the larger the business is, the less risk you’ll be willing to take even without regulatory requirements.

[John Gall’s book Systemantics](https://www.amazon.com/Systemantics-Systems-Work-Especially-They/dp/0812906748)
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

My advice to leaders is simple: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. The patterns you see are opportunities to evolve your structure, either by creating more or different structure or removing

but that doesn’t mean that applying the lessons from a successful complex system will let you replicate that success in other places.

Success, on the other hand, tempts us with the silver bullet, that one weird trick that could make everything great. If you want to learn from success, make sure you can identify the actual improvement you’re seeking when applying those lessons more broadly, and that you understand the context required to repeat that success.

This is fundamentally about learning.

### Creating your culture

Frederick Laloux, [Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/)

So what is culture? Culture is the generally unspoken shared rules of a community.

cultural values are the glue that enables us to work as a team and make decisions when faced with uncertainty.

thoughtfully created set of values that are actually values should reduce the kinds of surface discrimination that often happen at tech companies in favour of creating a real community of employees who share core principles and ways of communication.

employees who truly embrace and exhibit all of the core values of a company tend to do well naturally. The fit is easy for them.

### Applying your culture

- First, define your culture. If you have a set of company values, map those values onto your team.
- Second, reinforce your culture by rewarding people for exhibiting its values in positive ways.
- Finally, use this as part of your interview process. Remind your interviewers of the values of the team, and ask them to look out explicitly for places where the interviewee seems to match or collide with these values.

cultural fit is not about hiring friends.

### Creating a cultural policy

**Salary structure**

we had no salary structure at all. Because of that lack of structure, most people were paid based on a combination of their previous jobs’ salary and their negotiating skills.

John Allspaw’s blog post [“On Being a Senior Engineer”](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)

Writing a career ladder:

- Solicit participation from your team.
- Look for examples.
- Use both long-form descriptions and summaries.
- Consider how the ladder relates to salary.
- Provide many early opportunities for advancement.
- Use narrow salary bands for early-career stages.
- Use wide salary bands when and where you have fewer levels.
- Consider your breakpoint levels
- Recognise achievement.
- Split management and technical tracks.
- Consider making people management skills a mid-career requirement.
- Years of experience.
- Don’t be afraid to evolve over time.

You need this wiggle room to retain talent who are performing well at their current levels but are not ready to take on the additional responsibility of the next level.

You may even want to use it as the point at which your ladder levels get harder to achieve. Expect your team to cluster around this level, with fewer people above or below it.

### Cross-functional teams

Call them what you want — “pods” or “squads” or “pillars” — but cross-functional product development groups are a popular structure for a good reason. By putting everyone who is needed to make a project successful together in one group, you help the members of those teams focus on the project at hand, and you make the communication for the whole group much more effective.

When we put cross-functional teams together, we are acknowledging that the most important communication — the communication that we need to favour above all else — is that which leads to effective product development and iteration. Note that this structure will not necessarily produce the most effective technology! In fact, it will probably produce systems that have some inefficiencies compared to companies that have a more engineering-centred team structure.

This meant that you could still get technical guidance and oversight from your engineering manager, but your day-to-day work was determined by the needs of the pod’s roadmap.

Without any process, your teams will struggle to scale. With the wrong process, they will be slowed down.

Think of process as risk management. As your teams and systems grow, it’s almost impossible for any one person to keep the systems in her head.

you should not put a complicated process on any activity where you want people to move quickly and where you believe the risk for change in that activity is low or that the risks themselves are obvious to the whole team.

you need to be on the lookout for places where there is hidden risk, and draw those hidden risks out into the open.

### Developing engineering processes

**Code reviews**

Code review is, for better or worse, a modern standard. Once you have a team of a certain size with a certain number of people working on a code base, code review can be a valuable tool for ensuring the stability and long-term quality of that code base.

**Postmortem**

instead of calling the process a postmortem, many have started calling it a “learning review” to indicate that its purpose is not determining cause of death but learning from the incident.

- Resist the urge to point fingers and blame.
- Look at the circumstances around the incident and understand the context of the events.
- Be realistic about which takeaways are important and which are worth dropping.

**Architecture review**

How many people on the team are comfortable using this new system/writing this new language? Do we have production standards in place for this new thing? What is the process for rolling this out and training people to use it? Are there new operational considerations for using this?

- Be specific about the kinds of changes that need architecture review.
- The value of architecture review is in preparing for the review.
- Choose the review board wisely.

### Assessing your own experience

- What policies do you have now? What practices? Have you written any of them down yet?
- When was the last time you revisited them? Do you have company values? What are they?
- How do you recognise them in your team? Do you have a career ladder? Do you feel it accurately reflects the team today? Does it reflect the team you want to have in the future? If not, can you improve it? What risks are most concerning for your team? For your company?
- How can you mitigate those risks without burdening your team with unnecessary processes and bureaucracy?

## Chapter 10

you have to be able to manage yourself if you want to be good at managing others. The more time you spend understanding yourself, the way you react, the things that inspire you, and the things that drive you crazy, the better off you will be.

Great managers are masters of working through conflict.

[tarabrach.com](https://www.tarabrach.com/) and the writings of [Pema Chödrön](https://pemachodronfoundation.org/).

Think about the other perspectives at play. Investigate your emotional reactions, and observe when those reactions make it hard to see clearly what’s going on around you, what needs to be said. Apply that curiosity to people. Apply it to process. Apply it to technology, and strategy, and business. Ask questions, and be willing to have your notions proven wrong.
