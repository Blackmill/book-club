# The Manager's Path

**JAN 22**

## 1: Management 101

### What to expect from a manager

**Personal experience: what made them good managers:**

- Understanding the work to be done and the constraints on it
- Strong vision to put across to the team, and made clear what your role is on that team
- Not micro-managers and allow people to make their own mistakes, and gave support as needed
- Trusted and be apart of something bigger
- People's managers
- Shielded the team from demanding product owners and account managers

Camille talks more about day to day routines:

- 1:1 meetings - congratulate or deal with issues regularly
- Feedback and workplace guidance
- Training and career growth

### How to be managed

- What do you want
- Be responsible for yourself
- Choose your manager
- Interview the management
- If you plan to do your own thing, choose a workplace that has a track record of people that started on their own.

## Mini retro

- Technical: work through the examples
- Non-technical: usually just have a discussion around the topic
- Use GitHub for notes, and make a GH issue for the next meeting so that people can add notes/comments/questions to help with the agenda
- Be more prepared!
- Better way to RSVP ??
