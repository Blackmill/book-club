# The Manager's Path

# JAN 22

## 1: Management 101

### What to expect from a manager

**Personal experience: what made them good managers:**

- Understanding the work to be done and the constraints on it
- Strong vision to put across to the team, and made clear what your role is on that team
- Not micro-managers and allow people to make their own mistakes, and gave support as needed
- Trusted and be apart of something bigger
- People's managers
- Shielded the team from demanding product owners and account managers

Camille talks more about day to day routines:

- 1:1 meetings - congratulate or deal with issues regularly
- Feedback and workplace guidance
- Training and career growth

Mentioned by Michael: [Office Vibe](https://www.officevibe.com)

### How to be managed

- What do you want
- Be responsible for yourself
- Choose your manager
- Interview the management
- If you plan to do your own thing, choose a workplace
  that has a track record of people that started on their own.

## Mini retro

- Technical: work through the examples
- Non-technical: usually just have a discussion around the topic
- Use GitHub for notes, and make a GH issue for the next meeting
  so that people can add notes/comments/questions to help with the agenda
- Be more prepared!
- Better way to RSVP ??

## 2: Mentoring

**Three types of mentoring:**

- Interns
- New hires
- Technical or career mentoring

### Camille's tips

- Don't disappear
- Listen carefully
- Communicate clearly
- Calibrate your responses
- Prepare for their arrival
- Have a project for them to work on
- Have them present at the end of the program

### And a few more

- A good mentor is someone who has more experience than you
- Can communicate that experience.
- They're not answering the questions for you,
  but steering you in the right direction to answer them for yourself.
- Someone to both challenge you and support you through those challenges.

When being mentored, you need the opportunity to have discussions
about *why* this technology or that process is being chosen. 

Mentioned: [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) 

Giving mentees an understanding that there may be reasons outside the technology itself
for making technology choices could be good for self-esteem
as well as giving them the opportunity to have a more well-rounded perspective.

From a mentee's point of view, it's really nice to have a mentor
who is willing to be vulnerable.
Someone who is willing to say: "I don't know, let's work it out together."

Mentioned: "Confident humility" phrase by Angela Harms,
which she talks about on
this [Ruby Rogues podcast](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/049-rr-agile-communication-with-angela-harms/)

## 3: Tech Lead

Camille says that being a tech lead is a lot more responsibilities for probably not more pay.
However, if you wish to climb the management ladder, then it is a good role to experience.

Being a tech lead or a manager doesn't mean you have to be the best developer.
But most of the group feels a technical manager needs to stay technical (to some degree.)

Being a tech lead should be a role rather than a position.
You don't have to be a super experienced developer to be able to lead a team.
What you actually need are good communication skills, empathy, and organisational skills.

## 4: Managing People

#### Starting a new reporting relationship

- Build trust and rapport
- [Questions for our first 1:1 by Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)
- Create 30/60/90-day plan
- Encourage participation by updating eh new hire documentation
- Communicate expectations
- Get feedback from a new hire, with a grain of salt

#### Have 1:1s

- Regular scheduled sessions
- Styles:
  - To-do list meeting
  - The catch-up
  - The feedback and coaching meeting
  - The progress report
  - Getting to know you
- Outside of office
- Keep notes
- Share those notes with your report

#### Micromanager vs delegator

- Autonomy
- Tips for efficient delegation:
  - Use the team's goals to understand which details you should dig into
  - Gather information from the systems before going to people
  - Adjust your focus depending on the stage of projects
  - Establish standards for code and systems: for example, style guide, and pull request reviews
  - Treat open sharing of information in a neutral to positive way

#### Creating a culture of continuous feedback

- Know and observe the people on the team
- Give yourself a task to regularly identify people who deserve a praise
- Provide lightweight, regular feedback
- It will help people accept corrective feedback when the time comes
- Go beyond "good job"

#### Performance reviews

> You owe your team enough time to read the collected feedback, digest it, and summarize it well

- Try to account for the full year, not just the last couple of months
- Use concrete examples and excerpts from peer reviews
- Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths
- When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused
- Don't report all grudges, be selective and critical.
- Avoid big surprises!!

#### Cultivating careers

- Identify growth potential
- Familiarise yourself with the promotion process

#### Firing

- Performance improvement plan

> Depending on the company, such a plan might actually be an effort to turn an employee around, but often the plan is written in such a way that the person can’t possibly hope to achieve the goals in the allotted time, and it’s just a generous way of giving someone time to look for another job before being fired.

- Notes from previous 1:1 and feedback sessions for HR

### Assessing your own experience

1. Have you set up regular 1-1s with your direct reports?
1. When was the last time you talked to your reports about their career development? If it was more than three months ago, can you make sure to put this in your next 1-1s?
1. Have you given feedback to your reports in the last week? When was the last time you handed out kudos in front of the team?
1. When was the last time someone behaved in a way that needed correction? How long did it take you to give corrective feedback? Did you give the feedback in private, or did you do it in public?
1. Have you ever been given a performance review that felt like a waste of time? What was it missing that could have made it more valuable?
1. What was the most useful piece of performance feedback you ever got? How was it delivered to you?
1. Do you know how the process of promoting people works in your company? If not, can you ask someone to walk you through it?
