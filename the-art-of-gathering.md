# The art of gathering

- CH1: What is the reason for the gathering
  - Category is not enough
  - Commit to something
  - Purpose defines who should be invited
- CH2: Who and Where
  - Inviting is easy, excluding is hard
  - Group size -> different group dynamics
  - Venue is important
  - The château principle
  - Density suggestions
- CH3: Be an active host
  - Being a “child” host is doing a disservice to your guests.
    Instead acknowledge that you have a role, power, and authority
  - It’s not enough to set purpose, direction, and ground rules,
    you also need to enforce these
  - Generous authority
  - Example Alamo Draft House or Impact Hub LA
  - Connect your guests
  - Nora Abousteit rules for a host
- CH4: Create a temp escape from reality
  - Etiquette vs pop up rules
  - Example: I am here days
- CH5: Don’t start with logistics
  - Priming, before the event even starts,
    can be as simple as an email telling guests
what to bring
  - Ushering: psychological threshold
  - Launching: don’t start with talking about sponsors, or logistics,
    but instead by defining why we are gathered
- CH6: 15 toasts
  - Find ways to connect your guests, and help them be vulnerable
  - Dark themes
  - Sometimes it is easier to share with a stranger -
    that doesn't already have an image of who you’re supposed to be. Fresh eyes
- CH7: Cause good controversy
   - Get people to take a side, instead of being polite and not making a decision
  - Heat maps, safe spaces, and ground rules.
    Issues are complicated when they threaten people’s fears, needs, or self of identity.
  - Questions to ask: what would be the benefit in bringing something up?
    What is the risk? Is it worth it? Can it be done with care?
- CH8: Don’t end with logistics
  - Purposeful closing leaves a lasting taste, and reconnect with real life.
    Recall the purpose
  - Gathering are temporary
  - Last call
  - Anatomy of closing: looking inward and turning outward.
    A chance to reconnect one last time before the gathering ends
