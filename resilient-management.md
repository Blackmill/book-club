# Resilient Management

## Chapter Introduction

This book is here to help us manage teams

### What makes a team?

2+ people who share a strategic objective

There's plenty of ways of defining a team, but it doesn't really matter

#### Lexicon
* Teammates - the people in the team you manage, the people who report to you
* Discipline - function specific area of the org you work in. Design, FED, etc.
* Functional Team - a group of people who work in the same discipline
* Feature Team - people from different disciplines, working together on a feature

Teams are the atomic units of every org. We spent some time identifying how Lara's terms map to our own experiences.

### Tuckman's stages of group development
There are four stages a team can go through
* Forming - Few patterns or processes, might only just have formed
* Storming - Friction occurs because of differences
* Norming - Starting to find the grove, differences are worked out, clarity emerges
* Performing - Everyone is communicating well, and you're shipping

	These stages will repeat throughout the lifecycle of a team, even if you've been together for years. When a new person joins, or a manager changes, or the mission changes, these stages of group development can restart with those Forming stage feeling again. And since teams are in a constant state of change – as your hire, as you switch projects, as you develop roadmaps – you have an opportunity to address what's missing and how your teammates want to grow.

Any change in personnel, project or leadership can cause backsteps.

> Can anyone tell what stage their team is in? I think so.

#### What's in this book
Leadership, human growth and resiliency skills

#### What's not in the book
Strategy, Managing managers, Project managing

The chapters of the book serve the different stages of group development, chapter 1 is Forming

## Chapter 1

	As a manager, one of your primary jobs is to foster a foundation of trust on your team. This will be the underpinning of the team's overall health. To foster trust, you've gotta start by understanding each other: each person's needs, preferences, and approaches to work.

To do this, you need to understand them

Not everyone thinks or behaves like you do. Some people like public celebrations of promotion, others do not.

It takes time an effort to learn your teammates' different needs

### Humans' core needs at work

Two bits of the brain are relevant
* Prefrontal Cortex - Rationality and logic
* Amygdala - lizard brain

Humans have six core needs in the workplace (BICEPS)
* Belonging
* Improvement / Progress
* Choice
* Equality / Fairness
* Predictability
* Significance

These are more or less important depending on the individual, so ask them about which ones are important to them.

> How do they compare to the ones in Primed to Perform?

Anecdote: Someone discussed the book with a relative who worked in education management and they were familiar with the first 4 but hadn't used the last two in their work.

We spent some time discussing why that might be and whether our industry is different.

We went round the group identifying which of these core needs feel most important to each of us. Also discussed whether all 6 are needed in order to succeed and feel comfortable or whether perhaps it is approximate.

#### Same stimulus, different responses

People can react differently when these different needs are affected.

Desk moves are a great example of this, they can threaten each one of those needs, causing some people to dislike them

* Belonging - Removes a locality based social group
* Choice - Desk movements are often dictated, removing the choice from the individual
* Equality / Fairness - Some groups might be advantaged over others (closer to the windows etc.)
* Predictability - Breaks the routine of showing up to work in the same place day after day
* Significance - Could remove a person from a high status desk

We had a long conversation about desk moves. The different ways to think about the desk moves and how somebody's core needs might trigger negative responses in them.

### Work style and preferences

It's helpful to gather more information from your teammates over and above the core needs list.

	[I]nsights about each teammate's growth areas, preferences about feedback and recognition, and other aspects of their work. This is information I can refer back to as I assign work to them and help them grow.

_I'd like to ask you some cheesy questions to help better support you_

#### Grumpiness
* _What makes you grumpy?_
* _How will I know you're grumpy?_
* _How can I help you when you're grumpy_

	Grumpy is shorthand for so many things but this work keeps the question light and funny and easier to answer.

#### Feedback and recognition
* _In what medium do you prefer to recieve feedback (in person, email, chat)?_
* _When do you prefer to recieve feedback, in 1:1s or when it happens?_
* _How do you prefer to recieve recognition - publicly or privately?_

#### Goals and support
* _What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?_
* _What are your goals for this year, and the next three months?_
* _What do you need from your manager?_
* _What do you need from your teammates?_
* _What do you need from your peers outside the team?_

#### The wordy question
_Human learning and growth requires the right amout of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?_

#### The most important question
_What's your favourite way to treat yourself?_

None of us had an immediate answer to this. Or to many of the above. We think sharing these with your team beforehand to give them time to reflect would be useful.

They also need to get to know you as well as you know them!

### Help the team get to know you
Pay attention to your own superiors' styles, sharing your approach with your teammates helps you work together

There are different kinds of managers, people who focus on _getting shit done_ vs those that focus on growing the team, and so on

Your style will change how you do various things; coaching, giving feedback, scoping work, communicating news etc.

	What are you optimising for?

Think about the scenarios in which your particular management approach might manifest day to day, such as when you are:

 - coaching, mentoring, or sponsoring your reports;
 - requesting and delivering feedback;
 - goal setting or vision setting for/with your team;
 - scoping, delegating, and shipping work for/with your team; and
 - communicating to/with your teammates in different mediums.


There's a MadLib to help us figure this out:

I'm a ________ leader who value ________ and __________. You'll see this when I _____________________________. I support my team by ______________ and I stay aligned with company values by ____________. I thrive in a _____________ environment. I commit to being _____________________________.

#### Sharing with your teammates

An example, where a lead optimises for _long term relationships_, demonstrates that when that approach is understood by both parties, it improves things

Once you've done your MadLib, share what you learned with your teammates.
* _What do you optimize for in your role?_
* _What do you how your teammates will lean on you for?_
* _What management skills are you currently working on learning or improving?_

### Coaching questions

A list of useful questions to ask of ourselves

## Chapter 2: Grow your teammates

- Storming phase: when a group figures how to: work together, collaborate, hit goals, determine priorities. Defined with friction.
- Business-related: managers are also responsible for strategy-setting, aligning team's work to company's objectives, and help the team with blockers.
- Team-related: managers should help their teammates grow in their role, and support team's progress.

*Business related is sort of discussed in next chapter.
this chapter talks about how to grow the team as a manager but doesn't really discuss how to deal with friction and conflicts, except the section of teaching teammates how to give feedback, which has a hidden assumption: they are not good at giving feedback since there is friction and conflicts.
The book talks about collaboration in the next chapter. In my head, when the team doesn't know how to work together, it's the time to teach them about collaboration. Once collaboration and communication flows well, it is time to grow them.*

#### Four different hats

- Mentoring: giving advice and helping to solve problems based on own experiences
- Coaching: asking open questions to help reflect and introspect
- Sponsoring: finding opportunities for teammates to level up
- Delivering feedback: observing behaviour and sharing those observations

*Reflecting back to The Manager's Path, it discusses mentoring for new hires, interns, and technical or career growth, and giving feedback.*

Question: what is your default mode?

We agreed that we want to spend most of our time coaching, depending on the experience of the teammate. In order to get to spend time coaching, the team needs to be "self-mentoring", in a supportive environment. When teammates can seek advice from each other, the lead can focus on coaching.

Since it's easier to mentor than coach, falling back to mentoring could be considered "lazy".

**Mentoring**

Focus on problems and solutions. **Focus on mentor rather than mentee.**

> Our personal experiences are often what we can talk most confidently about! For this reason, mentorship mode can feel really good and effective for the mentor.

Be a responsible mentor when mentoring marginalised people from marginalised groups. Be aware of how they are perceived and unconscious bias that might be at play.

Pair programming

> Imaginative, innovative ideas often come from people who have never seen a particular challenge before, so if your mentee comes ip with a creative solution on their own that you wouldn't have thought of, be excited for them--don't just focus on the ways that you've done it or seen it done before.

*Exercism*

**Coaching**

1. Asking open questions - to help explore a topic deeper
2. Reflecting - hold a mirror for the other person

> Questions that start with *why* tend to make the other person feel judged, and questions that start with *how* tend to go into problem solving mode--both of which we want to avoid... However, *what* questions can be authentically curious!

- What's most important to you about it?
- What's holding you back?
- What does success look like?

Examples for a conversation about promotion, to help discover what it means:

- What would you be able to do in the new level that you can't do in your current role?
- What skills are required in the new level? what are some ways that you've honed those skills?
- Who are the people already at that level that you want to emulate? What about them do you want to emulate?

Then help teammates reflect by repeating back to them what you hear them say. Active listening.

**When coaching, we don't need to have all the answers, or fully understand the problem.**

> coaching can generate way more growth for that other person than just giving them advice or sharing your perspective.

**Sponsoring**

> Put their name in the ring for opportunities that will get them he experience and visibility necessary to grow in their role and at the organisation.

Most effective way to help someone get to the next level.

Examples:

- Giving public recognition
- Assigning stretch goals beyond their current skill set
- Give opportunities to write blog posts, present at conferences, contribute to open source

> Remember that members of underrepresented groups are typically over-mentored, but under-sponsored

This point was particularly well recieved by us!

Richard didn't feel like he had been sponsored before, didn't realise it was a thing until recently and so hasn't sponsored people. Others pointed out that he probably had been sponsored but didn't realise it. We discussed small ways to sponsor people, such as encouraging them to write blog posts.

https://hbr.org/ideacast/2019/06/the-surprising-benefits-of-sponsoring-others-at-work is a good podcast covering sponsorship.

**Feedback**

- Routinely deliver both positive and constructive feedback about their performance in their role.

Can only be done if the role is defined properly, and expectations are clear.

> Choose points from both their current level to see how well they're meeting these goals, as well as language from the next level up, to help them see how they can grow or where they're already excelling.

**Feedback equation**: feedback should be:

1. Specific
2. Actionable
3. Delivered in a way that ensures the receiver can actually absorb that

Write the feedback first, to ensure it makes sense and do a gut check to ensure it will get the receiver into a "fight/flight" mode.

1. Describe the facts of what happened: who/what/when/where
1. Describe the impact: on team, project, trust in them... focus on one effect that they care about
1. Request or question: instead of giving out a solution of what they should do, coach them on finding solutions on their own.

> Asking an open question at the end of delivering feedback is often much more powerful than making a request.

--
- Elle's definition of good feedback: clear, specific, timed right, non-judgmental, and speaks only to behaviour.
- Missing: when not to give feedback
- When positive feedback is given frequently, the negative feedback seems less threatening and more credible
- Actionable, Specific, Kind
- Intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation.

For example:
- Feedback: I think you should work on being more confident
- Intent: When you don't know something, be confident to admit it and ask questions
- Impact: I come across as doubtful or passive. I should give the impression I know all the answers

Compass of shame: represents the different ways we all respond to difficult feelings like shame, anger, guilt. or fear, but primarily shame

--

Example:
1. Observation: instead of "when you write emails, it seems like you're mad" or "you write emails that are too short", try "Over the last few weeks, I've noticed that your emails to me contain fewer than five words on average"
1. Impact: instead of "I think you are mad at me", try "this adds much more time to the overall process of us communicating", which is more measurable and possibly understandable by the other person
1. Question: "Can you help me understand what you're optimising for?"

> A culture of healthy feedback won't appear overnight, no matter how often you deliver feedback...foster that culture by teaching others how to deliver feedback in a healthy and impactful way.

Help ensure observations are just facts, without judgement or opinions. Help finding an impact that is clear and measurable. Then help with coming up with questions or a request for the feedback recipient.

When giving feedback as a third party, find an aspect of the feedback that you can personally own.

> Build feedback into your team routines, like retrospectives. Encourage your teammates to find opportunities to offer specific and actionable feedback--both positive and negative--to their teammates, as it will help the entire team grow stronger.

Feedback, we decided is tougher to give in practice, than it is to read about it. Preparing what to say in advance is a good idea, since coming up with intelligent things to say off the cuff is difficult.

Nick suggested that different communication methods might suite different types of feedback. We all agreed that while good feedback can be shared publically, negative or "constructive" feedback should be given privately.

Just "having a meeting" isn't necesarily a good way to share feedback if it blindsides people and nothing productive can happen in the meeting. Get around this with regular 1:1s and consistently share feedback. The alternative approach of sending feedback via email in advance can also backfire, with people responding with combative lists of rebuttals.

Although the short email example was a good one, the final question given of "what are you optimising for?" is a bit cringeworthy and could be interpreted as a snide attack.

Richard had a problem where a colleague refused to share feedback with a 2-up. To fix this, more emotional safety and feedback training could be implemented.

Adam pointed out that sometimes, the right thing to do is call "bullshit" on a person. Sometimes they even thank you for it later.

#### Striking a balance

Goals for 1:1s:

1. Build trust
2. Gain shared context
3. Plan and support career growth
4. Solve problems

Reflecting back to The Manager's Path, is discusses styles:

- To-do list meeting
- The catch-up
- The feedback and coaching meeting
- The progress report
- Getting to know you

- Coaching for building trust and helping someone grow. Same as sponsoring.
- Mentoring is if someone needs more direction.
- Feedback is critical always.

#### When it's not working

> Consider whether or not this teammate might flourish if they moved to a different part of the organisation. It is your responsibility to make sure you're not "passing a problem around."

Options:
- Move to another team
- Separating ways, especially when their behaviour is damaging to their teammates, or costing the business.

> **Set clear expectations across the team about how everyone works together to ship work, hit goals, and level up**

Homework:

- Practice lightweight positive feedback.
