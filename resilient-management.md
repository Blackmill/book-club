# Resilient Management

## Intro

There's a section on shared language. We spent some time identifying how Lara's terms map to our own experiences.

### Stages of group development

#### Tuckman's stages of group development

1. Forming
2. Storming
3. Norming
4. Performing

	These stages will repeat throughout the lifecycle of a team, even if you've been together for years. When a new person joins, or a manager changes, or the mission changes, these stages of group development can restart with those Forming stage feeling again. And since teams are in a constant state of change – as your hire, as you switch projects, as you develop roadmaps – you have an opportunity to address what's missing and how your teammates want to grow.
	
## Chapter 1: Meet your team

	As a manager, one of your primary jobs is to foster a foundation of trust on your team. This will be the underpinning of the team's overall health. To foster trust, you've gotta start by understanding each other: each person's needs, preferences, and approaches to work.
	
### Humans' core needs at work

1. Belonging
2. Improvement/Progress
3. Choice
4. Equality/Fairness
5. Predictability
6. Significance

Anecdote: Someone discussed the book with a relative who worked in education management and they were familiar with the first 4 but hadn't used the last two in their work.

We spent some time discussing why that might be and whether our industry is different.

We went round the group identifying which of these core needs feel most important to each of us. Also discussed whether all 6 are needed in order to succeed and feel comfortable or whether perhaps it is approximate.

#### Same stimulus, different responses

We had a long conversation about desk moves. The different ways to think about the desk moves and how somebody's core needs might trigger negative responses in them.

### Work style and preferences

	It can be really helpful to gather insights about each teammate's growth areas, preferences about feedback and recognition, and other aspects of their work. This is information I can refer back to as I assign work to them and help them grow.
	
#### Grumpiness

1. What makes you grumpy?
2. How will I know when you're grumpy?
3. How can I help you when you're grumpy?

	Grumpy is shorthand for so many things but this work keeps the question light and funny and easier to answer.
	
#### Feedback and recognition

1. In what medium (Slack, email, in person, etc) do you prefer to receive feedback?
2. When do you prefer to receive feedback - routinely in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?
3. How do you prefer to receive recognition - publicly or privately?

#### Goals and support

1. What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
2. What are your goals for this year? And for the next three month?
3. What do you need from your manager?
4. What do you need from your teammates?
5. What do you need from your peers outside the team?

#### The wordy question

	Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?
	
#### The most important question

	What's your favourite way to treat yourself?
	
None of us had an immediate answer to this. Or to many of the above. We think sharing these with your team beforehand to give them time to reflect would be useful.

### Help the team get to know you

	What are you optimising for?
	
Think about the scenarios in which your particular management approach might manifest day to day, such as when you are:

 - coaching, mentoring, or sponsoring your reports;
 - requesting and delivering feedback;
 - goal setting or vision setting for/with your team;
 - scoping, delegating, and shipping work for/with your team; and
 - communicating to/with your teammates in different mediums.
